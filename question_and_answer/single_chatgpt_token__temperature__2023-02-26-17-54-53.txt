prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.

Sure, here is a Python script that can perform the experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {'apiLevel': '2.11'}

# protocol run function
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # labware
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')

    # pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right')

    # reagents
    pbs = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '3').wells()[0]
    trypsin = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '3').wells()[1]

    # wash wells with PBS
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs)
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.aspirate(200, well.bottom(1))
            p1000.dispense(200, well.bottom(1))
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # add trypsin and wait
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well.bottom(1))
        protocol.delay(minutes=5)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # add DMEM
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, 'A1')
        p1000.dispense(1000, well.bottom(1))
        p1000.drop_tip()

```

The script uses the `opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul` for the p1000 pipette, and loads the `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat` as the destination plate. It also loads `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical` as the source for PBS, trypsin, and DMEM.

The script then washes the wells with PBS, adds trypsin, waits for 5 minutes, and adds DMEM.
