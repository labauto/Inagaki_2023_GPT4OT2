I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

I'm assuming you have the Opentrons Python API installed. If not, you can install it using the command `pip install opentrons`. The Opentrons Python Protocol API allows you to write Python scripts and protocols to automate laboratory workflows using an Opentrons OT-2. Please follow their documentation to learn more.

Here's a script that follows your desired protocol steps:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Automated Lab Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack_1000 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

    # Pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_1000])

    # Reagents
    pbs = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']  # PBS(-)
    trypsin = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']  # 0.25% trypsin solution
    dmem = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']  # DMEM medium

    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs)
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
            p1000.aspirate(1000, well)
        p1000.dispense(1000, pbs)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 ml of trypsin solution and wait for 5 minutes
    p1000.distribute(1000, trypsin, [well.top() for well in well_plate.wells()])
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.transfer(1000, dmem, well, new_tip='always')

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment("Experiment finished.")
```

Save this script as a Python file (for example, `automated_lab_experiment.py`) and upload it in the Opentrons App to execute the experiment. Make sure you've validated your protocol before starting the experiment. Please note that this script doesn't take into account any additional considerations such as optimizations for efficiency or specific handling instructions for the reagents.
