I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize E-Cadherin.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
To accomplish this task, we'll need to use the Opentrons API. Please ensure that you have installed the Opentrons package in your Python environment. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install opentrons
```

Here is a Python script to automate the preparation of immunostained hMSC cells to visualize E-Cadherin using an Opentrons robot:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Immunostaining hMSC cells for E-Cadherin',
    'author': 'Opentrons',
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
    tiprack_1 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '4')
    reservoir = protocol.load_labware('usascientific_12_reservoir_22ml', '2')
    
    # Setup Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_1])
    
    # Reagents
    cell_culture_medium = reservoir.wells_by_name()['A1']
    blocking_solution = reservoir.wells_by_name()['A2']
    primary_antibody_solution_ecad = reservoir.wells_by_name()['A3']
    secondary_antibody_solution = reservoir.wells_by_name()['A4']
    
    # Perform the experiment
    # --- Step 1: Aspirate cells from cell culture medium
    for well in plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(50, cell_culture_medium)
        p300.dispense(50, well)
        p300.mix(3, 50, well)
        p300.blow_out(well.top())
        p300.drop_tip()

    # --- Step 2: Apply blocking solution
    for well in plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(50, blocking_solution)
        p300.dispense(50, well)
        p300.mix(3, 50, well)
        p300.blow_out(well.top())
        p300.drop_tip()

    # --- Step 3: Apply primary anti-E-cadherin antibody solution
    for well in plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(50, primary_antibody_solution_ecad)
        p300.dispense(50, well)
        p300.mix(3, 50, well)
        p300.blow_out(well.top())
        p300.drop_tip()

    # --- Step 4: Apply secondary antibody solution
    for well in plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(50, secondary_antibody_solution)
        p300.dispense(50, well)
        p300.mix(3, 50, well)
        p300.blow_out(well.top())
        p300.drop_tip()
```

Please note that this script is a general outline for the experiment. Depending on the specific protocols and reagents used in your lab, you might need to adjust the script according to your requirements.

Make sure to test the script using an Opentrons simulator first before running it on an actual robot.
