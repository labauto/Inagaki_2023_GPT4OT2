    It seems like the error is caused by a syntax issue in the Python protocol code. However, the error message includes extra text that is not relevant to the actual error message. Can you provide me with the actual Python protocol code that you are trying to run? That way I can try to help you debug the issue.
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
I can't fix this specific error for you, as it seems to be caused by a syntax issue in the Python protocol code and I don't have access to the code. However, I can give you some tips on how to fix syntax errors in Python code:

1. Look at the line number specified in the error message to identify where the error occurred.
2. Look at the line of code itself for any syntax errors, such as missing parentheses or quotes.
3. Look at lines of code before the error for any missing closing parentheses, quotes, or other syntax elements that might be causing issues.
4. Use a Python linter to identify syntax and style errors automatically. Some popular linters include PyLint and Flake8.

If you need further assistance, feel free to provide me with more specific details about the error message and the code that is causing the issue.
