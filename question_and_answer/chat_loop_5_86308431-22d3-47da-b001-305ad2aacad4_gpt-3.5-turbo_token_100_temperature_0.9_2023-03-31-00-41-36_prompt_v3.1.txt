    It looks like there is an error in your code due to some text that is not supposed to be there. Specifically, it seems like there is an error in a comment that may have accidentally gotten interpreted as code. To fix this error, you should remove the following line, as it is not valid Python code:
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
The error you received suggests that there is an issue with a comment in your code being interpreted as Python code. Based on the error message, it seems like the comment starts with the word "It" and has a "^" symbol indicating the location of the error.

To fix this issue, simply remove the line that contains this comment or edit the comment so that it is not interpreted as Python code. Comments in Python start with the "#" symbol, so make sure that any text that is meant to be a comment is preceded by this symbol.
