I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure, here is a sample script that you can use:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

robot.head_speed(x=18000,  y=18000,  z=5000,  a=700, b=700) # Set the speed of the robot head

# Define labware
p1000rack = labware.load('opentrons_10_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
trypsin_tube = labware.load('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
cell_plate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

# Define pipette
p1000 = instruments.P1000_Single(mount='right', tip_racks=[p1000rack])

# Define volumes
well_volume = 1000
trypsin_volume = 1000 * 0.25 / 100

# Wash plate
for well in range(6):
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    p1000.transfer(well_volume, trypsin_tube.wells(0), cell_plate.wells(well), mix_after=(5, 1000))
    p1000.drop_tip()

# Add trypsin
for well in range(6):
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    p1000.transfer(trypsin_volume, trypsin_tube.wells(0), cell_plate.wells(well), new_tip='never')
    p1000.mix(5, well_volume, cell_plate.wells(well))
    p1000.drop_tip()

# Add DMEM
for well in range(6):
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    p1000.transfer(well_volume, trypsin_tube.wells(0), cell_plate.wells(well), new_tip='never')
    p1000.mix(5, well_volume, cell_plate.wells(well))
    p1000.drop_tip()

# Finish experiment
robot.comment("Done")

```

Please note that you will need to make sure that your robot's configuration and labware match the ones used in this script. If you have any further questions or require assistance please let me know.
