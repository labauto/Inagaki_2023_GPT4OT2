prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
Certainly! Here's a Python script that uses the Opentrons API to automate the process of exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6-well plate:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Define the labware
plate_6_well = labware.load('6-well-plate', '1')
trough_1 = labware.load('trough-12row', '2')
trough_2 = labware.load('trough-12row', '3')

# Define the pipettes
pipette_300 = instruments.P300_Single(
    mount='left',
    tip_racks=[labware.load('opentrons-tiprack-300ul', '4')],
    trash_container=labware.load('point', '5')
)

# Define the reagents
PBS_minus = trough_1.wells('A1')
D_MEM = trough_2.wells('A1')

# Define the volumes to aspirate and dispense
volume_to_aspirate = 200
volume_to_dispense = 200

# Define the transfer method
def exchange_medium(well_location, from_location, to_location):
    pipette_300.pick_up_tip()
    pipette_300.aspirate(volume_to_aspirate, from_location)
    pipette_300.dispense(volume_to_dispense, well_location)
    pipette_300.aspirate(volume_to_aspirate, well_location)
    pipette_300.dispense(volume_to_dispense, to_location)
    pipette_300.drop_tip()

# Perform the experiment
for well in plate_6_well.wells():
    exchange_medium(well, PBS_minus, D_MEM)
```

This script defines the labware to be used (a 6-well plate, two 12-row troughs, a tip rack, and a trash container) and the pipette to be used (a P300 Single-Channel pipette). It also defines the location and volumes of the reagents to be used (PBS(-) in the first row of trough 1, and D-MEM in the first row of trough 2).

The script then defines a transfer function called `exchange_medium`, which aspirates 200 uL of medium from the from_location, dispenses 200 uL of medium into the well_location, aspirates 200 uL of medium from the well_location, and dispenses 200 uL of medium into the to_location. This function uses the `pipette_300` pipette to perform the transfers, and picks up and drops tips as necessary.

Finally, the script performs the experiment by iterating over all wells in the 6-well plate and using the `exchange_medium` function to exchange the cell culture medium between the PBS(-) and D-MEM solutions.
