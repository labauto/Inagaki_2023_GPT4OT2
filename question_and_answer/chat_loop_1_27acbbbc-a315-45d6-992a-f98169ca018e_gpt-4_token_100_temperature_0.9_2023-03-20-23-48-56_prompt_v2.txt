prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

Sure, I can help you write a Python script to use with an Opentrons OT-2 robot. As a starting point, please follow the official Opentrons API documentation at https://docs.opentrons.com/ for detailed instructions on how to set up and use the Opentrons API.

Here's a Python script for the specified experiment, which exchanges the hMSC cell culture medium in a 6-well plate using PBS(-) and D-MEM:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Medium Exchange',
    'author': 'Your Name <youremail@domain.com>',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_generic_2ml_screwcap', '2')
    cell_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

    # Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagents
    pbs_minus = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    d_mem = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']

    # Procedure
    for well in cell_plate.wells():
        # Aspirate 1 mL of medium from well
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(1000, well)
        p300.dispense(1000, well)
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Add 2 mL of PBS(-) to each well
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(800, pbs_minus)
        p300.dispense(800, well)
        p300.aspirate(200, pbs_minus)
        p300.dispense(200, well)
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Aspirate 2 mL of PBS(-) and medium from each well
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(1000, well)
        p300.dispense(1000, well)
        p300.aspirate(1000, well)
        p300.dispense(1000, well)
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Add 2 mL of D-MEM to each well
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(800, d_mem)
        p300.dispense(800, well)
        p300.aspirate(200, d_mem)
        p300.dispense(200, well)
        p300.drop_tip()
```

Be sure to customize the script as needed for your specific hMSC cell culture medium exchange procedure. Note that this protocol assumes certain labware and pipette models, so be sure to adjust the labware and instrument names as required to match your experimental setup. This script also assumes that the correct amount of medium is removed and exchanged, adjust these volumes in the aspiration and dispense steps to fit your specific protocol.
