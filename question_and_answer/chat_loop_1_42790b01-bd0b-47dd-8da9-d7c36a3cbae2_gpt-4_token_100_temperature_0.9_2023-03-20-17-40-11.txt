prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

First, import the opentrons library and define the run function. Once you have done that, follow the provided instructions for your experiment. Here's an example Python script to run your experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.10',
    'protocolName': 'Automated Labware Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated laboratory experiment using Opentrons machine.',
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Load labware
    tiprack_1000 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 1)
    tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 2)
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 3)

    # Load pipette
    pipette_1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_1000])

    # 1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    wells = well_plate.wells()
    pbs_minus = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A3']
    for well in wells:
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.aspirate(1000, pbs_minus)
        for _ in range(5):
            pipette_1000.dispense(800, well)
            pipette_1000.aspirate(800, well)
        pipette_1000.dispense(1000, pbs_minus)
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

    # 2. Add trypsin solution to the cell culture dish
    trypsin = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['C3']
    for well in wells:
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.transfer(1000, trypsin, well, new_tip='never')
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

    # 3. Wait for 5 minutes
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # 4. Add cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    dmem = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['D3']
    for well in wells:
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.transfer(1000, dmem, well, new_tip='never')
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from opentrons import simulate
    protocol = simulate.get_protocol_api('2.10')
    run(protocol)
```

Make sure to modify the metadata section with your information. This script assumes the PBS(-) is in position A3, trypsin is in position C3, and DMEM is in position D3 on the tube rack. Update the well positions according to your actual labware setup.
