    It seems like the Python protocol you uploaded has the Python API Version 1.0 which is no longer supported by the robot server version 4.0.0 and above. To fix it you need to update your Python code to Python API Version 2.0 or above which is supported by the current robot server version.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
It seems like you have included an error message as part of your Python script, which is causing a syntax error. Please remove the error message and provide the actual code that you want me to help you with.
