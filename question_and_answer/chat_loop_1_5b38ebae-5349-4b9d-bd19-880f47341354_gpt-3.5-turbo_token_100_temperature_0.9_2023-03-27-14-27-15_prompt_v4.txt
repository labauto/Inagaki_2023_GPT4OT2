I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Sure, here's an example Python script that uses OpenTrons API to perform the experiment you described:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments

# Load the 6 well plate for cell culture
culture_plate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
# Load the 96 well flat bottom plate for spheroids formation
spheroid_plate = labware.load('96-well-plate-flat', '2')
# Define the tips to use
tiprack_200 = labware.load('tiprack-200ul', '3')

# Define the pipette
pipette = instruments.P300_Single(
    mount='right',
    tip_racks=[tiprack_200],
    aspirate_flow_rate=50,
    dispense_flow_rate=50,
    aspirate_speed=50,
    dispense_speed=50
)

# Transfer 100ul of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in spheroid_plate.wells():
    pipette.transfer(100, culture_plate.wells(0), well, new_tip='never')
pipette.drop_tip()

# Transfer 100ul of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in spheroid_plate.wells():
    pipette.transfer(100, culture_plate.wells(0), well, new_tip='never')
pipette.drop_tip()

# Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid),
# and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in spheroid_plate.columns_by_name()['2'][::2]:
    pipette.transfer(0.1, culture_plate.wells(1), well, new_tip='never')
    pipette.transfer(1, culture_plate.wells(2), well, new_tip='never')
    pipette.transfer(1, culture_plate.wells(3), well, new_tip='never')
pipette.drop_tip()

# Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in spheroid_plate.wells():
    pipette.transfer(100, culture_plate.wells(4), well, new_tip='never')
pipette.drop_tip()

# Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in spheroid_plate.wells():
    pipette.transfer(100, culture_plate.wells(4), well, new_tip='never')
pipette.drop_tip()

# End of script
print('Experiment completed!')
```

Here, we first load the required labware and define the pipette settings. We then use the pipette object to transfer the required volumes of medium and cells to the 96 well plates. Finally, we print a confirmation message that the experiment is completed.

Note: This script is only an example and may need to be adjusted based on your specific experimental requirements and UI.
