I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Here is a Python script using the Opentrons API that performs the described experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Spheroids Formation',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'hMSC spheroids formation in 96-well plates with and without osteoinduction supplements',
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tip_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    reagent_reservoir = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '2')
    os_minus_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '3')
    os_plus_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '4')

    # Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tip_rack])

    # Reagents
    dmem = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()['A1']
    dmem_high_glucose = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()['A2']
    dex = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()['A3']
    aa = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()['A4']
    bgp = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()['A5']
    hmsc_cells = reagent_reservoir.wells_by_name()["A6"]

    # Transfer 100 µL of DMEM to each well of the 96-well plate (OS-)
    for well in os_minus_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, dmem, well)

    # Transfer 100 µL of DMEM high glucose to each well of the 96-well plate (OS+)
    for well in os_plus_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, dmem_high_glucose, well)

    # Add supplements to each well of the 96-well plate (OS+)
    for well in os_plus_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(0.1, dex, well, mix_after=(3, 25))
        p300.transfer(1, aa, well, mix_after=(3, 25))
        p300.transfer(1, bgp, well, mix_after=(3, 25))

    # Transfer 100 µL of hMSC cells to each well of the 96-well plate (OS-)
    for well in os_minus_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, hmsc_cells, well, mix_after=(3, 25))

    # Transfer 100 µL of hMSC cells to each well of the 96-well plate (OS+)
    for well in os_plus_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, hmsc_cells, well, mix_after=(3, 25))

    # End
```

This script assumes that on the deck in specific order:
- Opentrons 96 Tiprack 300µL in slot 1
- NEST 12 reservoir 15ml in slot 2, where reagents are placed in wells A1-A5 (in order: DMEM, DMEM high glucose, Dex, AA, and BGP)
- Corning 96-well plate flat in slots 3 (OS-) and 4 (OS+)
- Using a P300 single-channel pipette (gen2) on the right mount for liquid handling.

Please let me know if you'd like me to add or modify anything.
