prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize E-Cadherin.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Sure. Here is an example Python script that uses the Opentrons machine to prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize E-Cadherin: 

```
# Import the required libraries
from opentrons import labware, instruments

# Define the labware
plate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')

# Define the instruments
pipette = instruments.P300_Single(mount='left')

# Define the reagents
primary_antibody = 'A488 anti-E-Cadherin'
secondary_antibody = 'A594 anti-mouse'

# Define the steps for the experiment
pipette.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate.wells():
    # Add primary antibody to each well of the plate
    pipette.transfer(50, primary_antibody, well.top())

    # Incubate for 1 hour at 37 degrees Celsius

    # Wash with PBS buffer
    pipette.transfer(100, plate['A1'], well.top())

    # Add secondary antibody to each well of the plate
    pipette.transfer(50, secondary_antibody, well.top())

    # Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature

    # Wash with PBS buffer
    pipette.transfer(100, plate['A1'], well.top())

    # Add DAPI stain to each well of the plate
    pipette.transfer(10, 'DAPI', well.top())

    # Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature

    # Wash with PBS buffer
    pipette.transfer(100, plate['A1'], well.top())

# Finish the script
pipette.drop_tip()
```

This script uses the Opentrons machine to transfer the primary and secondary antibodies, wash the cells with PBS buffer, and add a DAPI stain to each well of the plate. You would need to modify the script to include the specific reagents and incubation times for your experiment.
