I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

To write a Python script for an Opentrons machine, you will need to use the Opentrons API. Below is a Python script for the requested experiment. We have indicated which portions are specific to each step.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC spheroids experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'Automating hMSC spheroids experiment with Opentrons',
    'apiLevel': '2.9'
}

def transfer_medium(pipette, source, dmem_wells, hg_wells):
    for well in dmem_wells:
        pipette.transfer(100, source, well)

    for well in hg_wells:
        pipette.transfer(100, source, well)

def add_supplements(pipette, source, os_plus_wells):
    for supp in source:  # Assumes sources are in a list (Dex, AA, BGP)
        volume = [0.1, 1, 1]  # Corresponding volumes for Dex, AA, BGP
        for well in os_plus_wells:
            pipette.transfer(volume[i], supp, well)

def transfer_cells(pipette, source, os_minus_wells, os_plus_wells):
    for well in os_minus_wells:
        pipette.transfer(100, source, well)

    for well in os_plus_wells:
        pipette.transfer(100, source, well)

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Load labware
    tips = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', location='1')
    hmsc_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', location='2')
    medium_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', location='3')
    dmem_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_15ml_conical', location='4')
    dmem_tube = dmem_tube_rack['A1']
    hhg_tube = dmem_tube_rack['A2']
    supplements_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap', location='5')
    dexamethasone = supplements_tube_rack['A1']
    ascorbic_acid = supplements_tube_rack['A2']
    beta_glycerophosphate = supplements_tube_rack['A3']
    source_supplements = [dexamethasone, ascorbic_acid, beta_glycerophosphate]
    hmsc_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_15ml_conical', location='6')
    hmsc_source = hmsc_tube_rack['A1']

    # Load Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tips])

    # Distribute medium
    os_minus_wells = hmsc_plate.columns()[0:6]
    os_plus_wells = hmsc_plate.columns()[6:12]

    transfer_medium(p300,dmem_tube, os_minus_wells, os_minus_wells)
    transfer_medium(p300,hhg_tube, os_plus_wells, os_minus_wells)

    # Add supplements
    add_supplements(p300, source_supplements, os_plus_wells)

    # Transfer hMSC cells
    transfer_cells(p300, hmsc_source, os_minus_wells, os_plus_wells)

    protocol.end()

```

This script is divided into multiple functions, each performing a specific step within the experiment. This code requires the installation of the Opentrons API in your computer or the OT-2 robot to run.
