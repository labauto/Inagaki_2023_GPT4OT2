prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure! Here's a Python script that should perform the steps you provided on the Opentrons machine:

```
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Define the labware

# First, create a tube rack that can hold the trypsin
trypsin_rack = labware.load('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '1')

# Next, create the wells that will hold the PBS and DMEM
wells = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')

# Define the pipette

# Use a p1000_single pipette for the PBS and DMEM 
pipette = instruments.P1000_Single(
    mount='right',
    tip_racks=[labware.load('opentrons-tiprack-1000ul', '8')]
)

# Define the steps of the protocol

# Step 1: Wash wells with PBS
for well in wells.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, trypsin_rack.wells(0))
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    pipette.mix(5, 1000)
    pipette.drop_tip()

    robot.pause() # wait for PBS to settle

# Step 2: Add trypsin solution
for well in wells.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, trypsin_rack.wells(1))
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    pipette.mix(5, 1000)
    pipette.drop_tip()

    robot.pause() # wait for trypsin to settle

# Step 3: Add cell culture medium
for well in wells.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, trypsin_rack.wells(2))
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    pipette.mix(5, 1000)
    pipette.drop_tip()

    robot.pause() # wait for medium to settle

# Step 4: End of protocol
print('Experiment completed')
```

A few notes on the script:
- The `load` function is used to load different labware onto designated slots in the Opentrons machine. The first argument specifies the type of labware and the second argument specifies the slot it should be placed in.
- The `robot.pause()` function is used to give time for solutions to settle before moving on to the next step.
- Tip usage is managed automatically by the Opentrons API, so you don't need to worry about changing or refilling tips manually.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
