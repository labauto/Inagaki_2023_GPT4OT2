SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
It looks like there is an invalid syntax error in the Python script. Without seeing the full code, it's difficult to identify the exact error. However, based on the error message, it seems that there is a colon followed by asterisks, which is not a valid syntax. 

Please review the code for any typo and make sure that all the syntax is valid. If you are unable to correct the error, please provide the full script so I can assist you better.
