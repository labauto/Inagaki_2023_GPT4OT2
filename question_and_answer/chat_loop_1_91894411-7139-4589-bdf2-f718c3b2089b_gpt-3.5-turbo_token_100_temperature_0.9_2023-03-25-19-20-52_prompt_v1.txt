prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 µL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure, here's the Python script that will run the experiment you described:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Load labware
tube_rack = labware.load('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '1')
plate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')

# Load pipettes
pipette_1000 = instruments.P1000_Single(mount='right')

# Define volumes
PBS_volume = 1000  # µL
trypsin_volume = 1000  # µL
medium_volume = 1000  # µL

# Define commands
def wash_plate():
    pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.aspirate(PBS_volume, tube_rack.wells('A1'))
        pipette_1000.dispense(PBS_volume, well)
        pipette_1000.aspirate(PBS_volume, well)
        pipette_1000.dispense(PBS_volume, well)
    pipette_1000.drop_tip()

def add_trypsin():
    pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.aspirate(trypsin_volume, tube_rack.wells('A2'))
        pipette_1000.dispense(trypsin_volume, well)
    pipette_1000.drop_tip()

def add_medium():
    pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.aspirate(medium_volume, tube_rack.wells('A3'))
        pipette_1000.dispense(medium_volume, well)
    pipette_1000.drop_tip()

# Run the commands
wash_plate()
robot.pause("Please wait for 5 minutes after adding trypsin solution.")
add_medium()
```

You will need to copy and paste this into the Opentrons Protocol Designer software which can be found on their website. I hope this helps you get started with running experiments on the Opentrons machine! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
