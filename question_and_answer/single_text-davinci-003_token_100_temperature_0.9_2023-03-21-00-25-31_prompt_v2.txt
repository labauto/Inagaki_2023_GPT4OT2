prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
import opentrons

# Connect Opentrons Robot
robot = opentrons.Robot()

# Define the labware
plate = robot.load_labware('6well_plate', '1')
trough = robot.load_labware('trough_12row', '2')
tiprack = robot.load_labware('tiprack_10ul', '3')

# Define the pipettes
pipette = robot.load_instrument('p10_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack])

# Define the reagents (old medium, new medium and PBS)
old_medium = trough['A1']
new_medium = trough['A2']
pbs = trough['A3']

# Exchange the medium
for well in [well for row in plate.rows() for well in row]:
    # Dispense 10 uL of old medium
    pipette.transfer(10, old_medium, well, new_tip='always')
    # Rinse the well with 10 uL of PBS
    pipette.transfer(10, pbs, well, new_tip='always')
    # Dispense 10 uL of new medium
    pipette.transfer(10, new_medium, well, new_tip='always')

# Home the robot
robot.home()
