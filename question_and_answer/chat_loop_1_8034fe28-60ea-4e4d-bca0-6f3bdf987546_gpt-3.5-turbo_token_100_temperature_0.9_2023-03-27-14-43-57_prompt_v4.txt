I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Sure, here's a Python script that should achieve what you're looking for using the Opentrons machine:

```
from opentrons import protocol_api

# set up the Opentrons API
metadata = {'apiLevel': '2.10'}
protocol = protocol_api.ProtocolContext(metadata=metadata)

# define the plate positions
plate_96_os_minus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', 1) # OS- plate
plate_96_os_plus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', 4) # OS+ plate
plate_6_hmsc = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 2) # hMSC plate


# transfer DMEM to each well of OS- plate
for well in plate_96_os_minus.wells():
    protocol.transfer(100, plate_6_hmsc.wells()[0], well)

# transfer DMEM high glucose to each well of OS+ plate, then add osteoinduction supplements
for well in plate_96_os_plus.wells():
    protocol.transfer(100, plate_6_hmsc.wells()[0], well.top())
    protocol.transfer(0.1, protocol.load_labware('eppendorf_1.5ml_snapcap', 5).wells()[0], well, new_tip='always')
    protocol.transfer(1, protocol.load_labware('eppendorf_1.5ml_snapcap', 5).wells()[1], well, new_tip='always')
    protocol.transfer(1, protocol.load_labware('eppendorf_1.5ml_snapcap', 5).wells()[2], well, new_tip='always')

# transfer hMSC cells to each well of both plates
for well in plate_96_os_minus.wells() + plate_96_os_plus.wells():
    protocol.transfer(100, plate_6_hmsc.wells()[1], well, mix_before=(3, 50))

# end the protocol
protocol.comment("Protocol complete.")
``` 

Note that the above code assumes that the hMSC plate contains DMEM in the first well and the hMSC cells in the second well (positions 0 and 1, respectively), and that the three osteoinduction supplements (Dex, AA and BGP) are in the first, second and third wells of an Eppendorf 1.5mL snapcap tube, respectively (positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively). You may need to adjust these positions to match your specific experimental setup.
