prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure! Here's a Python script that automates the protocol steps you outlined using the specified labware and pipettes:

```
# Import necessary classes from opentrons module
from opentrons import labware, instruments

# Define the labware
tube_rack = labware.load("opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical", "1")
plate = labware.load("corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat", "2")

# Define the pipettes
pipette = instruments.P1000_Single(mount="left", tip_racks=[tube_rack])

# Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times and then discard
for well in plate.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tube_rack.wells(0))
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    for _ in range(5):
        pipette.aspirate(800, well)
        pipette.dispense(800, well)
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Add 1 mL of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes
pipette.pick_up_tip()
pipette.aspirate(600, tube_rack.wells(1))
pipette.dispense(600, plate.wells()[0])
pipette.mix(5, 500, plate.wells()[0])
pipette.drop_tip()

# Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
for well in plate.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tube_rack.wells(2))
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Finish the experiment
print("Experiment finished!")
```

Note that the script assumes that the specified labware and pipettes are physically present on the Opentrons machine in the correct slots. If you use different labware and pipettes, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly. Additionally, you may need to adjust the pipetting volumes based on your specific experiment.
