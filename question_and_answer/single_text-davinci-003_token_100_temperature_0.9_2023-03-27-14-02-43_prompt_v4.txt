I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End
