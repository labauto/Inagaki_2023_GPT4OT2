I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Here's a Python script using the Opentrons API to automate the hMSC spheroids experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    "apiLevel": "2.11"
}

def transfer_medium(ctx, pipette, plate, start_well_index, volume, medium_type, dest_plate):
    for well_index in range(start_well_index, start_well_index + 48):
        pipette.transfer(volume, plate.wells(medium_type), dest_plate.wells(well_index), new_tip="always")

def add_supplements(ctx, pipette, supplements, plate):
    for well in plate.wells()[:48]:
        for supplement, volume in supplements.items():
            pipette.transfer(volume, supplement, well, mix_after=(3, 10), new_tip="always")

def transfer_cells(ctx, pipette, cells, start_well_index, dest_plate):
    for well_index in range(start_well_index, start_well_index + 48):
        pipette.transfer(100, cells, dest_plate.wells(well_index), new_tip="always")

def run(ctx: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack = ctx.load_labware("opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul", "1")
    supplement_stock_tuberack = ctx.load_labware("opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap", "2")
    medium_stock_plate = ctx.load_labware("corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat", "3")
    cell_stock_tuberack = ctx.load_labware("opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap", "4")
    dest_plate = ctx.load_labware("corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat", "5")

    # Reagents
    dmem_low = medium_stock_plate.wells("A1")
    dmem_high = medium_stock_plate.wells("A2")
    dex = supplement_stock_tuberack.wells("A1")
    aa = supplement_stock_tuberack.wells("A2")
    bgp = supplement_stock_tuberack.wells("A3")
    hmsc_cells = cell_stock_tuberack.wells("A1")

    supplements = {
        dex: 0.1,
        aa: 1,
        bgp: 1,
    }

    # Pipettes
    pipette = ctx.load_instrument("p300_single_gen2", "right", tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Transferring Media
    transfer_medium(ctx, pipette, medium_stock_plate, 0, 100, "A1", dest_plate)
    transfer_medium(ctx, pipette, medium_stock_plate, 48, 100, "A2", dest_plate)

    # Adding Supplements
    add_supplements(ctx, pipette, supplements, dest_plate)

    # Transferring Cells
    transfer_cells(ctx, pipette, hmsc_cells, 0, dest_plate)
    transfer_cells(ctx, pipette, hmsc_cells, 48, dest_plate)

    ctx.comment("Experiment Finished.")
```

This script defines the labware, reagents, pipette, and a few helper functions to transfer reagents and supplements, as well as the cell culture. It then uses these functions to perform the experiment as requested.
