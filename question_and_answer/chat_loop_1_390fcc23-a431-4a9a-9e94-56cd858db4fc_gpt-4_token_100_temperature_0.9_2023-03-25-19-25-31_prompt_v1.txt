prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Sure! Below is a Python script for an Opentrons experiment using the OT-2 Python Protocol API.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11',
    'protocolName': 'Opentrons Automation: Cell Culture Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automate washing, trypsinization, and adding cell culture medium'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '2')
    tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '5')
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')

    # Pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagents
    PBS = tube_rack.wells('A1')
    trypsin = tube_rack.wells('A2')
    DMEM = tube_rack.wells('A3')

    # Procedure

    # Step 1: Wash 6-well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.aspirate(1000, PBS)
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 mL of trypsin solution to cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, DMEM)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment (no additional actions needed)
```

Please make sure to customize the metadata for your specific experiment such as changing the author's name. This script assumes you're using the labware mentioned in your question. Make sure the reagents are in the correct wells of the tube rack and the labware is loaded into the correct slots on the deck. You can adjust these if needed.
