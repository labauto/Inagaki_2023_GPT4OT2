I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging iPS cell culture medium using PBS(-) and SCM130.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

Sure, here's a simple Python script that you can use for automating the process of exchanging iPS cell culture medium using PBS(-) and SCM130 on the Opentrons machine:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'iPS Medium Exchange',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated medium exchange for iPS cells using Opentrons',
    'apiLevel': '2.2'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Load labware
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
    reservoir = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '2')

    # Load pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'left')
    p300.flow_rate.aspirate = 50
    p300.flow_rate.dispense = 50

    # Define the positions of the wells in the plate
    wells = [well for row in plate.rows() for well in row]

    # Define the positions of the solutions in the reservoir
    pbs = reservoir['A1']
    medium = reservoir['A2']

    # Perform the medium exchange
    for well in wells:
        # Aspirate old medium
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(200, well.bottom(1.5))
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Wash with PBS
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(250, pbs)
        p300.dispense(250, well.bottom(1.5))
        p300.mix(5, 200, well.bottom(1.5))
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Add new medium
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(250, medium)
        p300.dispense(250, well.bottom(1.5))
        p300.mix(5, 200, well.bottom(1.5))
        p300.blow_out()
        p300.drop_tip()
```

This script loads a 6-well plate and a 12-well reservoir onto the Opentrons machine, uses a P300 single-channel pipette to aspirate and dispense solutions, and performs the following steps for each well in the plate:

1. Aspirate the old medium from the well.
2. Wash the well with PBS to remove any remaining traces of the old medium.
3. Dispense new medium into the well to replace the old medium. 

Note that this is a simple example script and may need to be adjusted or modified depending on your specific experiment requirements.
