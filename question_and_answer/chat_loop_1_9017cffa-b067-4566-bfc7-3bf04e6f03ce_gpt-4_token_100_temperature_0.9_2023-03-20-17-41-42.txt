prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Below is the Python script for the Opentrons machine that performs the desired experiment. To start, make sure you've installed the `opentrons` package.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# Metadata
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Automated Lab Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'A script for running an experiment using Opentrons machine.',
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 1)
    tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 2)
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16_8ml_flat', 3)

    # Pipette
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagent containers
    pbs_minus = tube_rack['A1']  # PBS(-)
    trypsin_solution = tube_rack['A2']  # Trypsin solution (0.25%)
    cell_culture_medium = tube_rack['A3']  # Cell culture medium (DMEM)

    # Protocol steps

    # Step 1: Wash 6-well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times.
    # For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):
            pipette.aspirate(1000, pbs_minus)
            pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish
    # and wait for 5 minutes.
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.transfer(1000, trypsin_solution, well)
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6-well plate.
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.transfer(1000, cell_culture_medium, well)

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment.
    protocol.comment('The experiment is complete.')
```

To run the script, save it as a .py file, and you can use the Opentrons app to upload and execute the script. For example, you can name the file as `automated_lab_experiment.py`. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/1809573-setting-up-and-running-a-new-protocol) to correctly set up and run the Opentrons machine.
