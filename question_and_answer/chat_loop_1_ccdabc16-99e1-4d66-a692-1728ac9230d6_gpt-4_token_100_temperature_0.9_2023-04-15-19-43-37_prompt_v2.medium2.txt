prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and SCM130.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

To control an Opentrons robot, you first need to install the Opentrons API. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install opentrons
```

I will write a basic Python script that simulates running an experiment using the Opentrons API, assuming you have an Opentrons OT-2 robot. This script exchanges the hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and SCM130. The cells are cultured in a 6-well plate. You may need to modify the script to match the specifics of your protocol and labware.

```python
from opentrons import simulate
metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.0'
}

protocol = simulate.get_protocol_api('2.0')
protocol.home()

# Labware
tiprack_300 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', 1)
trough = protocol.load_labware('agilent_12_reservoir_15000ul', 2)
plate_6_well = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 3)

# Pipette
p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_300])

# Reagents
pbs_minus = trough.wells_by_name()['A1']
scm130 = trough.wells_by_name()['A2']

# Wells in the 6-well plate
wells_to_fill = plate_6_well.wells()

# Exchange media in 6-well plate
for well in wells_to_fill:
    # Remove 50% of the medium with PBS(-)
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.aspirate(5_000, pbs_minus)  # Adjust the volume as needed
    p300.dispense(5_000, well)
    p300.drop_tip()

    # Add new SCM130 media
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.aspirate(5_000, scm130)  # Adjust the volume as needed
    p300.dispense(5_000, well)
    p300.drop_tip()

# Finish the experiment
protocol.comment("Experiment complete!")
```

Save this script as a .py file and upload it to your Opentrons App. Make sure to test the steps and volumes before running the actual experiment, as these values might need fine-tuning. Consult your labware manual or user guide for specific instructions.
