Can you write Python scripts that runs this wet experiment for me using opentrons library? but you can't rely on comment() function. Write the code that can be run in opentrons labware simulator (opentrons_simulate). The experiment is as follows:

Protocols:
1. Wash the cell culture dish with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each wash, use 2 ml of PBS(-) in the tube.
2. After washing, add 3 ml of trypsin solution to the cell culture dish and incubate for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 10 mL of cell culture medium to the cell culture dish.
4. Finish the experiment.

Example of the script is as follows:

```
import math
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    "protocolName": "Python Wet Experiment",
    "author": "Sak <sak@opentrons.com>",
    "description": "Custom Protocol Request",
    "apiLevel": "2.9"
}


def run(ctx):
    # implementation is here
    return
```

Your task is to implement the run() function.
