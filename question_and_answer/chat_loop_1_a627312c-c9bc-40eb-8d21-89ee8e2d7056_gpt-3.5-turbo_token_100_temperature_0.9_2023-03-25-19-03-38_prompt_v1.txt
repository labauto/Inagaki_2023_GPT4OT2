prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure! Here's a Python script that runs the protocol you described with the specified labware and pipettes:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Cell Culture Protocol',
    'author': 'Your Name Here <youremail@yourinstitution.com>',
    'description': 'A protocol for washing and treating cells in a 6 well plate',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

# Labware setup
tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
cell_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

# Pipette setup
p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Wash 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in range(6):
        p1000.aspirate(1000, tube_rack['A1'])
        p1000.dispense(1000, cell_plate.wells()[well])
        for i in range(5):  # pipette up and down 5 times
            p1000.aspirate(1000, cell_plate.wells()[well])
            p1000.dispense(1000, cell_plate.wells()[well])
    p1000.drop_tip()

    # Add trypsin and wait for 5 minutes
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in range(6):
        p1000.aspirate(1000, tube_rack['A2'])
        p1000.dispense(1000, cell_plate.wells()[well])
    p1000.delay(minutes=5)

    # Add cell culture medium
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in range(6):
        p1000.aspirate(1000, tube_rack['A3'])
        p1000.dispense(1000, cell_plate.wells()[well])
    p1000.drop_tip()
```
Make sure to double-check the labware and slots you use because these may vary depending on your specific setup. Also, be sure to calibrate your robot before running the script.
