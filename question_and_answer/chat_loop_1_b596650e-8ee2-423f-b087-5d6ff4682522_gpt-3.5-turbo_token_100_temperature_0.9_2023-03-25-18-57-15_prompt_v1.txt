prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
Sure, here's a Python script that should do what you described:

```
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Cell Culture Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name Here',
    'description': 'A protocol to automate washing of 6 well plates, adding trypsin, then adding DMEM medium',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}


def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # load labware and pipettes
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '10')
    falcon_tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '11')
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # commands
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # pick up tip from the tiprack

    for well in plate.wells():
        pipette.aspirate(1000, falcon_tuberack['A1'])  # wash well with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        for i in range(5):
            pipette.mix(5, 600, well)  # 5 times up and down mixing
        pipette.aspirate(1000, well)  # aspirate the PBS(-)
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)  # dispense the PBS(-)
        pipette.aspirate(1000, falcon_tuberack['A2'])  # add trypsin solution (0.25%) to the well
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)  # dispense the trypsin solution
        protocol.delay(minutes=5)  # wait for 5 minutes
        pipette.aspirate(1000, falcon_tuberack['A3'])  # add DMEM medium to the well
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)  # dispense the DMEM medium

    pipette.drop_tip()  # drop tip to the waste container
```

To run the script, copy and paste it into the Opentrons protocol editor and hit the "run" button. Also, make sure that you have connected your Opentrons machine and loaded the labware and pipettes described in the script. Finally, double-check the labware slots and the pipette types.
