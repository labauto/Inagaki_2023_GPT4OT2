prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.


###



answer:*************************

#!/usr/bin/python



print("Curing MSC CULTURE IN ")



# Transforming the culture medium into PBS(-)



pump_mccc(mcgliebert@dynip.org, "Curing MSC CULTURE IN"),watch_cell_i(4, 4),

watch_cell_ii(4, 6), Astonish(3, 4),

opentrons_machine(2, 2),

opentrons_script(opentrons_idle, 1, input_name))



# Springing into production



print("OPENTRONS STARTED")



opentrons_machine()

opentrons_script(opentrons_idle, input_name)
