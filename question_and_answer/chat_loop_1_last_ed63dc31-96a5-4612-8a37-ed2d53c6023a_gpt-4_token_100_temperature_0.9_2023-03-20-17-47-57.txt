prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Here's a Python script to run the Opentrons machine according to the protocol steps given:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    
    # Labware
    trypsin_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 1)
    pbs_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 2)
    tiprack_1000 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 3)
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 4)
    
    # Pipette
    p1000_single = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_1000])
    
    # Protocol Steps

    # Step 1: Washing the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times.
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000_single.pick_up_tip()
        p1000_single.transfer(
            1000,
            pbs_tube_rack['A1'],
            well,
            mix_after=(5, 1000),
            new_tip='never'
        )
        p1000_single.blow_out(well.top())
        p1000_single.drop_tip()
        
    # Step 2: Adding 1 ml trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and waiting for 5 minutes.
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000_single.transfer(
            1000,
            trypsin_tube_rack['A2'],
            well,
            new_tip='once'
        )
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)
    
    # Step 3: Adding 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000_single.transfer(
            1000,
            trypsin_tube_rack['A3'],
            well,
            new_tip='once'
        )
        
    # Step 4: Finishing the experiment.
    protocol.comment('Experiment Finished.')
```

This script should work for your desired protocol steps. However, please ensure that the labware and slots are set up according to your specific Opentrons machine configuration.
