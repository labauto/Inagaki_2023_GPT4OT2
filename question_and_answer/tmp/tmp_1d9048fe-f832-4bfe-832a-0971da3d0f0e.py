I cannot fix this specific error for you, as it seems to be caused by a syntax issue in the Python protocol code and I don't have access to the code. However, here are some tips on how to fix syntax errors in Python code:

1. Look for the line number where the error occurred, indicated by the "line" number in the error message.
2. Check the syntax of the code on that line. Common syntax errors include missing parentheses, commas, or quotes.
3. Double-check that all opening parentheses, brackets, and quotes have corresponding closing characters.
4. You can also try running your code through an online Python syntax checker or using a Python IDE with a built-in linter or debugger to help identify issues in your code.

I hope these tips help you resolve the issue with your code.
