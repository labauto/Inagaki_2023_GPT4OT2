This error looks like it's being raised from a script you've written. The syntax error suggests that there is a problem on line one of the Python script, which may be due to an error in the formatting or keywords used. To fix this error, you'll need to look at the code you've written and see what's causing the problem. 

One clue could be the error message: "It seems that the well name 'C1' is not found in the source plate. Please check if the name of the well is correct and if it exists in the source plate." If you're trying to access well 'C1', you may need to ensure that the name of the well is correct and that it exists in the plate you are trying to access.
