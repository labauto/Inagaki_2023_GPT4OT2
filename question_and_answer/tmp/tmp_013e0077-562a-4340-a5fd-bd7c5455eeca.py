This error is indicating that the Python protocol you uploaded to the Opentrons robot is no longer supported (version 1.0). The minimum supported Python API version is now 2.0 to ensure compatibility with the latest robot server version 4.0.0.

To fix this error, you will need to upgrade your protocol to use the Python API version 2.0 or above. You can consult the Opentrons documentation here: https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html.
