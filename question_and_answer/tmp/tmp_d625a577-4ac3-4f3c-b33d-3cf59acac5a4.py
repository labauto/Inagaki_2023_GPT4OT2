Based on the error message, it seems like the Python script you have written is using an older version of the Opentrons API (Version 1.0) which is not supported by the current Robot Server version (4.0.0) you are using. 

To fix this error, you will need to upgrade your Python script to use API version 2.0 or above. You can refer to the Opentrons documentation to learn about the changes made to the newer API versions and how to upgrade your code accordingly. 

Another option is to downgrade your Robot Server version to a version that is compatible with API version 1.0.
