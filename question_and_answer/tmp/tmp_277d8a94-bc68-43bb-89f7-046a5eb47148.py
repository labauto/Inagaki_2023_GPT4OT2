Sure, I can help with that!

First, you will need to install the Opentrons API, which is the Python library used to communicate with the robot. You can do that by running the following command:

```
pip install opentrons
```

Then, you can use the following Python script as a starting point for your experiment:

```
from opentrons import robot, instruments, containers

# Set up the robot
robot.connect()

# Define the containers
plate = containers.load('6-well-plate', 'A1')

# Define the instruments
pipette = instruments.P10_Single(mount='left')

# Define the volumes
media_volume = 100 # µL
antibody_volume = 5 # µL

# Define the positions
media_position = (plate[0].top(), plate[0].bottom(2/3))
antibody_position = (plate[0].top(), plate[0].bottom(1/3))

# Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize E-Cadherin
pipette.pick_up_tip()
pipette.aspirate(media_volume, media_position[0])
pipette.dispense(media_volume, media_position[1])
pipette.aspirate(antibody_volume, antibody_position[0])
pipette.dispense(antibody_volume, antibody_position[1])
pipette.drop_tip()

# Disconnect the robot
robot.disconnect()
```

This script will connect to the Opentrons robot, load a 6-well plate, define a P10 single-channel pipette, and define the volumes and positions for the media and antibody. It will then pick up the tip, aspirate the media, dispense it into the cells, aspirate the antibody, dispense it into the cells, and drop the tip.

Note that this script assumes that you have already prepared the cells and have them in the correct position on the 6-well plate. You will need to modify the positions in the code to match the specific positions of your cells. Also, make sure that you are using the correct size of tips for your pipette.
