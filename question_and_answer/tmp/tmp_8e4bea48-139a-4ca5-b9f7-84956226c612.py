The error you received suggests that there is an issue with a comment in your code being interpreted as Python code. Based on the error message, it seems like the comment starts with the word "It" and has a "^" symbol indicating the location of the error.

To fix this issue, simply remove the line that contains this comment or edit the comment so that it is not interpreted as Python code. Comments in Python start with the "#" symbol, so make sure that any text that is meant to be a comment is preceded by this symbol.
