I don't see the full script, but based on the error message it seems like there might be an issue with the syntax on line 76 of the script. You can't use the `*` syntax to unpack a list in a for loop like that. Instead you can use `itertools.chain` to concatenate the lists together. Here's what it should look like:

```
import itertools

# define the tubes containing thapsigargin
tube_A1 = [35]
tube_A2 = [10]
tube_A3 = [1]
tube_A4 = [0.1]
tube_A5 = [0.01]
tube_A6 = [0.005]
tube_B1 = [0.001]
tube_C1 = [0.00001]
tube_D1_to_D6 = [1.56, 3.12, 6.24, 12.52, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 2000]

# concatenate all the tubes together
all_tubes = itertools.chain([tube_A1, tube_A2, tube_A3, tube_A4, tube_A5, tube_A6, tube_B1], tube_C1, tube_D1_to_D6)

# iterate over all the tubes to prepare the drug dilutions
for tube in all_tubes:
    # TODO: add your code here
```

Make sure to replace `TODO: add your code here` with the code that prepares each dilution.
