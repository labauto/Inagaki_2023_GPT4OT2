- transfer medium (DMEM) to each well
OS(-)
- transfer medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well
- add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well
- do transfer

The Python script will then use the Transfer function to transfer the medium (DMEM) to each well of the 96 well plate (OS+) in order to make a hMSC spheroids. The Transfer function will then use the Transfer function to transfer the medium (DMEM) to each well of the 96 well plate (OS-) in order to make a hMSC spheroids. The Transfer function will then use the Transfer function to transfer the medium (DMEM) to each well of the 96 well plate (OS-) in order to make a hMSC spheroids.
