This error suggests that the protocol being run may have been written for an older version of the Opentrons API. To fix the error, you should add `"metadata": {"apiLevel": "2.0"}` in the protocol's JSON file. The `metadata` field should be added at the beginning of the file, below the first curly brace `{`. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "protocolName": "My Protocol",
    "author": "John Smith",
    "description": "This protocol does X, Y, and Z",
    "apiLevel": "2.0"
  },
  
  "thermocycler": {...},
  "pipettes": {...},
  "labware": {...},
  "instructions": [...]
}
```

Make sure to replace the `apiLevel` value with the appropriate API version that you are using. If the error persists, you can try updating your Opentrons API to the latest version.
