This error message indicates that the Python protocol you created is not compatible with the current version of the Opentrons robot server. The protocol was created with Python API Version 1.0, and the current version of the robot server (4.0.0) no longer supports that version.

To fix this error, you need to upgrade your protocol to Python API Version 2.0 or above. You can refer to the Opentrons documentation for details on how to do this. If you need further assistance, you can contact Opentrons support for guidance.
