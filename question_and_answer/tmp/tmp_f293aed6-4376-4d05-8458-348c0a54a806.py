It looks like you have included a command for installing the `opentrons` library in your Python script, which is causing a syntax error. 

Please remove the installation command from your script and make sure that the library is already installed on your system before running the script. 

As long as the library is properly installed, you should be able to import and use it in your script without including an installation command.
