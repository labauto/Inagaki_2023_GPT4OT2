I can't fix this specific error for you, as it seems to be caused by a syntax issue in the Python protocol code and I don't have access to the code. However, I can give you some tips on how to fix syntax errors in Python code:

1. Look at the line number specified in the error message to identify where the error occurred.
2. Look at the line of code itself for any syntax errors, such as missing parentheses or quotes.
3. Look at lines of code before the error for any missing closing parentheses, quotes, or other syntax elements that might be causing issues.
4. Use a Python linter to identify syntax and style errors automatically. Some popular linters include PyLint and Flake8.

If you need further assistance, feel free to provide me with more specific details about the error message and the code that is causing the issue.
