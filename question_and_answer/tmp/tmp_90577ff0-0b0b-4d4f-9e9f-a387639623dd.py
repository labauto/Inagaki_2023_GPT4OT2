Yes, it seems the error is due to the missing `apiLevel` key in the protocol metadata. Here's a modified version of the script with the `"apiLevel": "2.0"` key added:

```
metadata = {
    "protocolName": "Viability and Cytotoxicity Assays for A549 cells with Thapsigargin",
    "author": "Your Name Here",
    "apiLevel": "2.0"
}

from opentrons import protocol_api

# Define protocol
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

     # Add your protocol code here

```

Adding this line to `metadata` should resolve the error you encountered.
