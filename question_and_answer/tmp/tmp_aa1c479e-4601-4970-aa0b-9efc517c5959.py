Sure, please try replacing the first line of your script with the following:

```
metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.0',
    'protocolName': 'hMSC spheroid formation assay',
    'author': 'Your name here',
    'description': 'A protocol to culture and make hMSC spheroids, with or without osteoinduction supplements in a 96 well plate using the Opentrons robot.'
}
``` 

This should define the API level for your script and provide some basic information about the protocol.
