Sorry, it seems like there's an issue with the Opentrons API. Can you try upgrading the Opentrons API using the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install opentrons --upgrade
```

This should upgrade the Opentrons API and fix any issues related to it. Let me know if you still face any issues after upgrading the API.
