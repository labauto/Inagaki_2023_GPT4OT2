I am unable to provide an exact solution to the issue without seeing your complete code. However, based on the provided error message, it seems that the problem is related to loading the labware. The error occurs when trying to load the 'opentrons_96_tiprack_200ul' tip rack at line 14 in your code.

To resolve the issue, you can try two possible solutions:

1. Check the spelling of the labware name and make sure it is correct. It should match the labware specified in your Opentrons library. The error message suggests that the labware name might be misspelled, or the version and namespace are not correctly specified.

2. If you are using custom labware, make sure that the appropriate labware definition is added to your Custom Labware Definitions Folder in the Opentrons App.

If the problem persists, please provide the relevant part of your code that causes the issue, particularly the lines where you are loading labware. This would help me to provide a more precise solution.
