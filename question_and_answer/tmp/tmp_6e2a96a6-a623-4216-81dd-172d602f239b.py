Unfortunately, I cannot fix this error as it is related to the compatibility of the Python protocol version and the robot server version. The error message suggests downgrading the robot server version or upgrading the protocol to Python API Version 2.0 or above. The error message also provides a link to Opentrons documentation on upgrading protocols. I suggest following the steps outlined in the documentation or contacting Opentrons support for further assistance.
