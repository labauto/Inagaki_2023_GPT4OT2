Sorry about that, that error message is not actually valid Python code (it was just me providing you with some text). To resolve the issue with the Opentrons API, please run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install --upgrade opentrons
```
After upgrading your Opentrons API, please try running the Python script that I provided earlier.
