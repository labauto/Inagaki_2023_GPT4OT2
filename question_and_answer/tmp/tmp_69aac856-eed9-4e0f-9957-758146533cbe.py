I don't know why you are receiving this error without seeing the code. However, the error seems to be indicating that the Python protocol uploaded to the Opentrons robot is no longer supported (version 1.0) and needs to be upgraded to the minimum supported Python API version 2.0 to ensure compatibility with the latest robot server version 4.0.0. You can upgrade your protocol by following the OpenTrons documentation at https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html. Alternatively, you may consider contacting OpenTrons support to retrieve the previous software version and be guided through the downgrade process.
