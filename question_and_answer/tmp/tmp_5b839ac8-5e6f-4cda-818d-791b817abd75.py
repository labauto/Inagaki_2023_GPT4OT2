This error is due to the Python API Version used in the script being outdated and no longer supported in the current version of the Opentrons robot server. To fix it, you can upgrade your protocol to Python API Version 2.0 or above by viewing the documentation at https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html. Alternatively, you can contact Opentrons support to retrieve the previous software version and be guided through the downgrade process if you wish to keep using the current protocol.
