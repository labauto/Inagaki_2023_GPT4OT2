Based on the error message, it looks like the Python script you provided is using the Python API Version 1.0, which is no longer supported by the current robot server version 4.0.0. 

To fix this error, you can upgrade the Python API Version to at least 2.0 or above, as suggested in the error message. Alternatively, if you need to use Python API Version 1.0, you can contact Opentrons support to retrieve the previous software version and perform a downgrade. 

Note that I cannot provide a fixed Python script without knowing the specifics of your experiment and the Opentrons machine you are using.
