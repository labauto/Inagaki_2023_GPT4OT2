prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Sure, here's some sample code that uses the Opentrons Python API to automate preparing immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes:

```python
# Import Opentrons API modules
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Define labware
plate = labware.load('6-well-plate', '1')
tiprack = labware.load('tiprack-200ul', '2')

# Define pipette
p300 = instruments.P300_Single(
    mount='right',
    tip_racks=[tiprack])

# Define reagent locations
lysotracker = plate['A1']
primary_antibody = plate['A2']
secondary_antibody = plate['A3']
mounting_medium = plate['A4']

# Define steps of experiment
# Dispense Lysotracker
p300.pick_up_tip()
p300.aspirate(200, lysotracker)
p300.dispense(200, plate.wells('A1', to='F1'))
p300.drop_tip()

# Dispense primary antibody
p300.pick_up_tip()
p300.aspirate(200, primary_antibody)
p300.dispense(200, plate.wells('A2', to='F2'))
p300.drop_tip()

# Dispense secondary antibody
p300.pick_up_tip()
p300.aspirate(200, secondary_antibody)
p300.dispense(200, plate.wells('A3', to='F3'))
p300.drop_tip()

# Dispense mounting medium
p300.pick_up_tip()
p300.aspirate(200, mounting_medium)
p300.dispense(200, plate.wells('A4', to='F4'))
p300.drop_tip()
```

Note that this script assumes that the labware, pipettes, and reagents are all set up and ready to use. It also assumes that the Opentrons robot is properly calibrated and connected to your computer. You will need to modify the script as needed for your specific experiment and set up.
