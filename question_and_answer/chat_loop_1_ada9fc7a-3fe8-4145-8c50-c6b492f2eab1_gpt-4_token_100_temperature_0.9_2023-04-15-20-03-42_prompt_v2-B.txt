prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Writing the Python script would require knowing more details about the protocol you want to automate. However, here's a starting point you can use and modify as needed, assuming you are using the Opentrons API.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automation of immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.',
    'apiLevel': '2.8'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Define the labware (customize this part based on your experiment setup and labware specifications)
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')  # Replace with the tiprack you're using
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')

    # Define the pipettes
    p300_single = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])
    
    # Define the wells
    source_wells = well_plate.wells_by_name()['A1'], well_plate.wells_by_name()['A2'], well_plate.wells_by_name()['A3']
    
    # Write the experimental protocol
    # This can be modified based on reagents, specific pipetting steps, incubation times, etc. 
    # Here is an example of transferring 100 uL from a source well to a destination well in each well of the plate
    volume_to_transfer = 100

    for well_idx, source_well in enumerate(source_wells, start=1):
        destination_well = well_plate['A'+str(well_idx + 3)]

        # Pipetting steps
        p300_single.pick_up_tip()
        p300_single.aspirate(volume_to_transfer, source_well.bottom(1.5))
        p300_single.dispense(volume_to_transfer, destination_well.bottom(1.5))
        p300_single.blow_out(destination_well)
        p300_single.drop_tip()
```

This template serves as a starting point and should be customized based on the experiment's requirements. Replace the labware types and pipettes with the ones you have access to.

Please note to execute this protocol, you will need the OT-2 App and the as per the documentation: https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/.

Additionally, be sure to consult the Opentrons API documentation (https://docs.opentrons.com/) to ensure that the labware and pipettes match your experiment exactly.
