prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

#!/usr/bin/python



print("Curing IGH2 with Opentrons")

print("Curing IGH2 with upentrons")

print("Curing IGH2 with siglion")

print("Curing IGH2 with Opentrons and D-MEM")

print("Curing IGH2 with upentrons and siglion")

print("Curing IGH2 with siglion and Opentrons")

print("Curing IGH2 with Opentrons and D-MEM")

if __name__ == "__main__":

print("IUGH2 with Opentrons")

print("IUGH2 with upentrons")

print("IUGH2 with siglion")

print("IUGH2 with Opentrons")

if not isinstance(o, d):

print("IUGH2 with siglion")

except:

print("IUGH2 with Opentrons")

print("IUGH2 with upentrons")

print("IUGH2 with siglion")

except:

print("IUGH2 with Opentrons")

print("IUGH2 with upentrons")

print("IUGH2 with siglion")

except:

print("IUGH2 with Opentrons")

print("IUGH2 with upentrons")

print("IUGH2 with siglion")
