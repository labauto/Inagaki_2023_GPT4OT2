I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Sure, here is a Python script that uses the Opentrons machine to automate the described experiment:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments

# Load the labware
plate_96_OSminus = labware.load('96-flat', '1')
plate_96_OSplus = labware.load('96-flat', '2')
plate_6 = labware.load('6-well-plate', '3')

# Define the pipettes
p1000 = instruments.P1000_Single(mount='left', tip_racks=[labware.load('opentrons-tiprack-1000ul', '4')])
p10 = instruments.P10_Single(mount='right', tip_racks=[labware.load('opentrons-tiprack-10ul', '5')])

# Transfer DMEM to 96-well plate (OS-)
p1000.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate_96_OSminus.wells():
    p1000.transfer(100, plate_6.wells('A1'), well, new_tip='never')
p1000.drop_tip()

# Transfer DMEM high glucose to 96-well plate (OS+)
p1000.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate_96_OSplus.wells():
    p1000.transfer(100, plate_6.wells('A2'), well, new_tip='never')
p1000.drop_tip()

# Add OS+ supplements to 96-well plate (OS+)
p10.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate_96_OSplus.wells():
    p10.transfer(0.1, plate_6.wells('B1'), well, new_tip='never')
    p10.transfer(1, plate_6.wells('C1'), well, new_tip='never')
    p10.transfer(1, plate_6.wells('D1'), well, new_tip='never')
p10.drop_tip()

# Transfer hMSC cells to 96-well plate (OS-)
p1000.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate_96_OSminus.wells():
    p1000.transfer(100, plate_6.wells('E1'), well, new_tip='never')
p1000.drop_tip()

# Transfer hMSC cells to 96-well plate (OS+)
p1000.pick_up_tip()
for well in plate_96_OSplus.wells():
    p1000.transfer(100, plate_6.wells('F1'), well, new_tip='never')
p1000.drop_tip()

# End
print('Experiment is completed')
```

This script assumes that the labware is set up in the exact same way as described in the experiment, and that the Opentrons machine is connected and calibrated. You can customize the script as necessary to fit the specific conditions of your experiment.
