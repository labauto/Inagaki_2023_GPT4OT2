prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the cell culture dish (90 mm) with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each wash, use 2 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 3 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 10 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the cell culture dish.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes:
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `p300_single`

answer:*************************
Sure, here is a Python script that runs the Opentrons machine to perform the experiment you described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Cell Culture Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'A protocol to wash a cell culture dish and add trypsin and medium.',
    'apiLevel': '2.7'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Load the pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[])
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'left', tip_racks=[])

    # Define the labware
    wash_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_50ml_tube', 1)
    culture_dish = protocol.load_labware('corning_90mm_non-treated_petri_dish', 2)
    medium_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10ml_1_well_tube', 3)

    # Define the reagents
    pbs = wash_tube.wells()[0]
    trypsin = wash_tube.wells()[1]
    medium = medium_tube.wells()[0]

    # Wash the culture dish with PBS(-)
    for i in range(5):
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(2000, pbs)
        p1000.dispense(2000, culture_dish.wells()[0])
        p1000.aspirate(2000, culture_dish.wells()[0])
        p1000.dispense(2000, pbs)
        p1000.mix(5, 2000)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Add trypsin and wait for 5 minutes
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.aspirate(3000, trypsin)
    p300.dispense(3000, culture_dish.wells()[0])
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)
    p300.drop_tip()

    # Add cell culture medium
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    p1000.aspirate(10000, medium)
    p1000.dispense(10000, culture_dish.wells()[0])
    p1000.drop_tip()

    # Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment('Experiment finished.')
```

This script defines the protocol steps you provided and uses the Opentrons API to execute them. It uses a `p1000_single` pipette for dispensing the cell culture medium and a `p300_single` pipette for adding trypsin and washing the culture dish with PBS(-).

Please note that this is just a sample script, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific experiment and equipment setup. Be sure to follow all safety protocols and consult the documentation for your Opentrons robot and labware before running any experiments.
