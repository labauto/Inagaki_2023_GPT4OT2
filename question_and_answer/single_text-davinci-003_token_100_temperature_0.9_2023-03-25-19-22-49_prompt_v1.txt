prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

# Import Necessary Packages
from opentrons import protocol_api

# Load Protocol API
protocol = protocol_api.Protocol()

# Load Labware
tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 1)
plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 2)

# Load Pipette
pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks = [tuberack['A1']])

# Washing the 6 Well Plate with PBS(-)
for well in plate.wells():
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tuberack['A1'].wells()[0])
    for _ in range(5):
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.aspirate(1000, well)
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)

# Adding Trypsin Solution
for well in plate.wells():
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tuberack['A1'].wells()[1])
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)
    protocol.delay(minutes = 5)

# Adding Cell Culture Medium
for well in plate.wells():
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tuberack['A1'].wells()[2])
    pipette.dispense(1000, well)

# Finish the Experiment
protocol.home()
