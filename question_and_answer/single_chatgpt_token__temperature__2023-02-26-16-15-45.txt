prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the cell culture dish (90 mm) with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each wash, use 2 ml of PBS(-) in the 50 ml tube.
2. After washing, add 3 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 10 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the cell culture dish.
4. Finish the experiment.

As an AI language model, I am not capable of interacting directly with laboratory equipment or running Python scripts on a physical machine. However, I can provide you with a sample Python script that demonstrates how to use the Opentrons API to control the robot and perform the steps you described.

Before running the script, you will need to have Opentrons API installed on your machine and connect to the robot via USB or Wi-Fi.

Here is a sample Python script that performs the steps you described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# Define the protocol
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Cell Culture Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'A protocol to wash a cell culture dish and add trypsin and medium.',
    'apiLevel': '2.7'
}

# Define the protocol
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Load the pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[])
    p200 = protocol.load_instrument('p200_single', 'left', tip_racks=[])

    # Define the labware
    wash_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_50ml_tube', 1)
    culture_dish = protocol.load_labware('corning_90mm_non-treated_petri_dish', 2)
    medium_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10ml_1_well_tube', 3)

    # Define the reagents
    pbs = wash_tube.wells()[0]
    trypsin = wash_tube.wells()[1]
    medium = medium_tube.wells()[0]

    # Wash the culture dish with PBS(-)
    for i in range(5):
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(200, pbs)
        p1000.dispense(200, culture_dish.wells()[0])
        p1000.aspirate(200, culture_dish.wells()[0])
        p1000.dispense(200, pbs)
        p1000.mix(5, 200)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Add trypsin and wait for 5 minutes
    p200.pick_up_tip()
    p200.aspirate(300, trypsin)
    p200.dispense(300, culture_dish.wells()[0])
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)
    p200.drop_tip()

    # Add cell culture medium
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    p1000.aspirate(10000, medium)
    p1000.dispense(10000, culture_dish.wells()[0])
    p1000.drop_tip()

    # Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment('Experiment finished.')
```

This script uses two pipettes, a P1000 and a P200, to aspirate and dispense reagents, and loads the required labware and reagents for the experiment. It then performs the washing step, adds trypsin and waits for 5 minutes, adds the cell culture medium, and finally finishes the experiment.

Please note that this script is a sample and you may need to modify it to fit your specific experimental requirements.
