prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Here is a Python script for automating the process of exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in the Opentrons machine. I have divided the process into several steps and functions for better readability and modularity.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Cell Culture Medium Exchange',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'Automated medium exchange using Opentrons',
    'apiLevel': '2.9'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware and Pipettes
    def setup():

        plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 1)
        pbs_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_generic_2ml_screwcap', 2)['A1']
        dmem_tube = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_generic_2ml_screwcap', 2)['B1']
        tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 3)

        pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

        return plate, pbs_tube, dmem_tube, pipette

    # Remove cell culture medium
    def remove_old_medium(plate, pipette):
        for well in plate.wells():
            pipette.pick_up_tip()
            pipette.transfer(2000, well, well, new_tip='never')
            pipette.drop_tip()

    # Add PBS(-) to wash cells
    def wash_cells(plate, pbs_tube, pipette):
        for well in plate.wells():
            pipette.pick_up_tip()
            pipette.transfer(2000, pbs_tube, well, new_tip='never')
            pipette.drop_tip()

    # Add D-MEM
    def add_dmem(plate, dmem_tube, pipette):
        for well in plate.wells():
            pipette.pick_up_tip()
            pipette.transfer(2000, dmem_tube, well, new_tip='never')
            pipette.drop_tip()

    # Main function
    plate, pbs_tube, dmem_tube, pipette = setup()
    remove_old_medium(plate, pipette)
    wash_cells(plate, pbs_tube, pipette)
    add_dmem(plate, dmem_tube, pipette)
```

This script sets up the Opentrons environment, removes the old medium, washes the cells with PBS(-), and finally adds D-MEM to the wells. It is structured into small functions for each step, making it easy to modify or extend. Adjust the volume amounts and labware positions based on your specific experimental requirements.
