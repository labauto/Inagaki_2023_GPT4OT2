opentrons.protocols.types.ApiDeprecationError: 

The Python protocol you uploaded has the Python API Version 1.0.  Robot server version 4.0.0 is
the official end of life of Python API Version 1.0. The minimum supported Python API Version is 2.0. This means that this protocol
will not run in robot server version 4.0.0 and above.
Please downgrade your robot server version if you wish to run this protocol. Otherwise, please upgrade this
protocol to Python API Version 2.0 or above.

To upgrade your protocol to Python API Version 2.0 or above, please view our documentation at https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/index.html.

Please contact support@opentrons.com to retrieve the previous software version and be guided
through the downgrade process.



```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
Sorry, it looks like the error you received is related to the Python API version being used with the Opentrons robot, and it requires more information about the specific Python script you are trying to run. Could you please provide a copy of your Python script so that I can help you debug the problem?
