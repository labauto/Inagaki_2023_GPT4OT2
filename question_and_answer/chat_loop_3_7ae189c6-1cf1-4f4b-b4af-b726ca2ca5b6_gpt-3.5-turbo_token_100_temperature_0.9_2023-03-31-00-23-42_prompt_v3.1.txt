NameError: name 'labware' is not defined

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
Sure, it looks like the `NameError` is being raised because the `labware` module is not defined. You need to import the `labware` module from the Opentrons SDK at the top of your script, like this:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments
```

This will allow you to use the `load()` function to load your tip racks and other labware. Just make sure you have the Opentrons SDK installed and imported correctly.
