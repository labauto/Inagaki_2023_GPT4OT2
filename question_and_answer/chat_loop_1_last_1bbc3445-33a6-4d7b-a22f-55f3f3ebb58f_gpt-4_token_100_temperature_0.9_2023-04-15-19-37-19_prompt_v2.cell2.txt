prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging iPS cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
Here's a Python script using the Opentrons API to automate the exchange of iPS cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM on a 6-well plate. This assumes the pipettes and tips are installed on the robot, and the labware is placed at the appropriate slots as mentioned in the script.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'iPS Cell Culture Medium Exchange',
    'author': 'Your full Name <youremail@email.com>',
    'description': 'Automate the exchange of iPS cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6-well plate.',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tips_300 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    six_well = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')
    reagents_plate = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '3')

    # Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'left', tip_racks=[tips_300])

    # Reagents
    pbs_minus = reagents_plate['A1']
    d_mem = reagents_plate['A2']

    # Performing experiment
    for well in six_well.wells():

        # Aspirating and discarding the spent medium:
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(250, well)
        p300.dispense(250, pbs_minus)
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Washing cell with PBS(-):
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(250, pbs_minus)
        p300.dispense(250, well)
        p300.aspirate(250, well)
        p300.dispense(250, pbs_minus)
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Adding fresh D-MEM:
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(250, d_mem)
        p300.dispense(250, well)
        p300.drop_tip()
```

Remember to replace 'Your full Name' and 'youremail@email.com' with your actual information. The code assumes that the tips are in slot 1, the 6-well plate is in slot 2, and the reagents (PBS(-) and D-MEM) are in slot 3 in a 12-reservoir labware. Please adjust the positions according to your specific setup.
