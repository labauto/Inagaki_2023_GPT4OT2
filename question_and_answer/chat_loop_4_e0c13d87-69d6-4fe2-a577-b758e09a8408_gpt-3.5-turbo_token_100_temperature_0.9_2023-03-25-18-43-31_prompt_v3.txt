    I don't see the full script, so it's hard to say exactly what the issue is. However, based on the error message it seems like there might be an issue with the syntax on line 1 of the script where it says "I don't see the full script". This is not valid Python code and needs to be removed.
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
I don't know. Can you provide the full Python script that is causing the error?
