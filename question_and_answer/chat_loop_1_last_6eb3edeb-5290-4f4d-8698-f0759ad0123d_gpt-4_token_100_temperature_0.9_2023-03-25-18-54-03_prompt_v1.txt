prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Here is a Python script to control the Opentrons machine for your desired experiment using the Opentrons API:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.10',
    'protocolName': 'Automated Lab Experiment'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    
    # Load labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
    tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

    # Load pipette
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Locate reagents
    pbs = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['B1']
    dmem = tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A2']

    # Step 1: Wash the wells with 1 ml of PBS(-)
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):  # repeat 5 times
            p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs)
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the wells
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Pause for 5 minutes
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, dmem)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment("Experiment finished.")
```

You can modify and run the protocol script with your Opentrons machine's specific labware configuration as required. Make sure you have installed the required Opentrons Python API on your computer.
