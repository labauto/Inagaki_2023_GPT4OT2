I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

To write a python script for the Opentrons robot, you need to import the Opentrons API and create a protocol. Here's a basic script that covers your experiment requirements:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11',
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Spheroid Experiment'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack_10 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_10ul', '1')
    tiprack_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '2')
    src_plate_os_minus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '3')
    src_plate_os_plus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '4')
    dest_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '5')
    
    # Pipettes
    p10 = protocol.load_instrument('p10_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_10])
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack_200])

    # Reagent Positions
    dmem_medium = src_plate_os_minus['A1']
    dmem_high_glucose_medium = src_plate_os_plus['A1']
    dex = src_plate_os_plus['B1']
    aa = src_plate_os_plus['C1']
    bgp = src_plate_os_plus['D1']
    hmsc = src_plate_os_minus['H1']

    # Transfer DMEM medium for OS(-)
    for well in dest_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, dmem_medium, well, new_tip='always')
        
    # Transfer DMEM high glucose medium for OS(+)
    for well in dest_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, dmem_high_glucose_medium, well, new_tip='always')

    # Add osteoinduction supplements for OS(+)
    for well in dest_plate.wells():
        p10.transfer(0.1, dex, well, mix_after=(3, 10), new_tip='always')
        p10.transfer(1, aa, well, mix_after=(3, 10), new_tip='always')
        p10.transfer(1, bgp, well, mix_after=(3, 10), new_tip='always')

    # Transfer hMSC cells for OS(-) and OS(+)
    for well in dest_plate.wells():
        p300.transfer(100, hmsc, well, mix_after=(3, 100), new_tip='always')
```

This script assumes you are using Opentrons API version 2.11, and it uses standard labware (96 well plates and tips) filled with the required reagents. Please double-check the labware names and positions according to your actual labware and reagent positions on the robot.
