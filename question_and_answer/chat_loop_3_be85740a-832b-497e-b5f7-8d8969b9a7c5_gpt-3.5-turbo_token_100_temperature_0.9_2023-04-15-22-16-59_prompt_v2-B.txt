    Sorry, it looks like the error you received is related to the Python API version being used with the Opentrons robot, and it requires more information about the specific Python script you are trying to run. Could you please provide a copy of your Python script so that I can help you debug the problem?
              ^

can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.

Sorry for the confusion, as an AI language model, I am not able to access your local files or environment, and I cannot provide a response based on the error you received without seeing your code. Can you share your Python script here, or provide more details about the error message?
