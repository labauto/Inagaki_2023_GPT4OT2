I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Sure, here's the Python script that you can use to automate this experiment using Opentrons:

```python
# Import Opentrons Library and define protocol
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC spheroid culture',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated hMSC spheroid culture using Opentrons',
    'apiLevel': '2.2'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Define deck placement for 6-well plate, 96-well plate, and tip rack
    wellplate_6 = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
    wellplate_96 = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '2')
    tiprack_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '6')

    # Define pipette and its volume range
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_multi', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack_200])
    pipette.flow_rate.aspirate = 150
    pipette.flow_rate.dispense = 300
    pipette.flow_rate.blow_out = 300
    pipette.volume = 100

    # Define source and destination wells for medium, hMSC, and supplements
    medium_src = wellplate_6['A1']
    hMSC_src = wellplate_6['B1']
    medium_dest_os_minus = wellplate_96.rows()[0]
    medium_dest_os_plus = wellplate_96.rows()[1]
    supplement_dest = wellplate_96.rows()[1][:3]

    # Start transfer of medium and supplements
    pipette.pick_up_tip()

    # Transfer medium to OS- wells
    for row in medium_dest_os_minus:
        pipette.aspirate(100, medium_src)
        pipette.dispense(100, row)
        pipette.blow_out()

    # Transfer medium to OS+ wells and add supplements
    for row in medium_dest_os_plus:
        pipette.aspirate(100, medium_src)
        pipette.dispense(100, row)
        pipette.blow_out()

        # Add supplements to OS+ wells
        for supplement in supplement_dest:
            pipette.aspirate(1, supplement)
            pipette.dispense(1, row)
            pipette.blow_out()

    # Transfer hMSC cells to OS- and OS+ wells
    for row in medium_dest_os_minus + medium_dest_os_plus:
        pipette.aspirate(100, hMSC_src)
        pipette.dispense(100, row)
        pipette.blow_out()

    # End of the protocol
    pipette.drop_tip()
```

Make sure to adjust the deck placements of your labware according to your setup. You can also adjust the flow rates and volume ranges of the pipette to optimize the performance of the experiment.
