prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Here is a Python script using the Opentrons API to prepare the immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes. Please make sure that you have installed the Opentrons package and consult the Opentrons documentation for any customization you may need to do for your specific setup.

```python
from opentrons import simulate
protocol = simulate.get_protocol_api('2.11')

# Labware
tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
cell_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_3500ul_flat', '2')
reagent_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_generic_2ml_screwcap', '3')

# Pipettes
pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

# Reagents
lysosome_stain = reagent_rack.wells_by_name()['A1']
fixation_solution = reagent_rack.wells_by_name()['A2']
blocking_solution = reagent_rack.wells_by_name()['A3']

# Perform the experiment
# Add lysosome stain to hMSC cells in each well
for well in cell_plate.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(10, lysosome_stain)
    pipette.dispense(10, well)
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Incubate for a desired amount of time (1 hour as an example)
protocol.delay(minutes=60)

# Remove lysosome stain and wash with fixation solution
for well in cell_plate.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(350, well)
    pipette.dispense(350, lysosome_stain)
    pipette.aspirate(350, fixation_solution)
    pipette.dispense(350, well)
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Incubate for 15 minutes in fixation solution
protocol.delay(minutes=15)

# Wash with blocking solution
for well in cell_plate.wells():
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(350, well)
    pipette.dispense(350, fixation_solution)
    pipette.aspirate(350, blocking_solution)
    pipette.dispense(350, well)
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Incubate for another hour in blocking solution
protocol.delay(minutes=60)

# Dispose remaining liquids and remove labware

protocol.home()

print("Experiment completed!")
```

This script assumes that lysosome stain, fixation solution, and blocking solution are stored in specified wells of the reagent rack. The protocol aspirates and dispenses these reagents in the wells of the 6-well cell culture plate. It also includes delay steps to simulate incubation periods. You can customize it based on your specific experimental conditions and requirements.
