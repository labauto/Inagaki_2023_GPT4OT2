I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Sure, here's an example script that should run your experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {'apiLevel': '2.0'}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Load the labware and pipettes
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
    pbs_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'left', tip_racks=[protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '3')])

    # Add PBS(-) to the 6 well plate and wash 5 times
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        for i in range(5):
            p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs_rack['A1'])
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
            if i < 4:
                p1000.aspirate(1000, well)
                p1000.dispense(1000, pbs_rack['A1'])
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Add trypsin solution and wait 5 minutes
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.aspirate(1000 * 0.25, pbs_rack['A2'])
        p1000.dispense(1000 * 0.25, well)
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Add cell culture medium to the 6 well plate
    p1000.pick_up_tip()
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs_rack['A3'])
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
    p1000.drop_tip()
```

This script follows the protocol steps you described, and uses a p1000_single pipette and the labware you provided as an example. Note that you might need to adjust some values if your own labware and pipettes have different capacities or specifications.
