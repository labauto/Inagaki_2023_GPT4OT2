I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
To accomplish this task, you'll first need to install the Opentrons Python library using pip:

```
pip install opentrons
```

Once the library is installed, you can use the following Python script as a starting point for your experiment. Please note that you might need to adjust some values like tip racks, containers, pipettes, reagent volumes, and incubation times according to your specific experimental requirements.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api
import time

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Immunostaining hMSC Cells Protocol',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tips_20ul = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_20ul', '1')
    tips_200ul = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_200ul', '2')
    plate_6W = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')
    reagent_tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_6_tuberack_nest_15ml_conical', '4')
    waste_rack = protocol.load_labware('agilent_1_reservoir_290ml', '5')

    # Pipettes
    p20 = protocol.load_instrument('p20_single_gen2', 'left', tip_racks=[tips_20ul])
    p200 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tips_200ul])

    # Reagents
    lysosome_stain = reagent_tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    pbs = reagent_tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A2']

    # Protocol
    # Adding lysosome stain
    for well in plate_6W.wells():
        p20.transfer(1, lysosome_stain, well, mix_before=(3, 10), new_tip='always')

    # Incubate for 30 minutes
    protocol.delay(minutes=30)

    # Washing with PBS (3x)
    for _ in range(3):
        for well in plate_6W.wells():
            p200.transfer(150, pbs, well, new_tip='always')
            p200.transfer(150, well, waste_rack.wells_by_name()['A1'], new_tip='always')

    # Add mounting medium with DAPI (nuclear stain)
    for well in plate_6W.wells():
        p20.transfer(2, reagent_tube_rack.wells_by_name()['A3'], well, mix_before=(3, 10), new_tip='always')

    # Incubate for 10 minutes
    protocol.delay(minutes=10)
```

This script imports the Opentrons library and customizes the protocol's metadata. The script defines where the labware should be placed on the deck and the pipettes required for the protocol. It also specifies the reagents to be used in the experiment. The actual protocol describes the steps required to immunostain hMSC cells for lysosomes.

You may need to adjust the script according to your specific requirements, e.g., reagent volumes, incubation times, and labware brands. Additionally, you'll need to test and calibrate your Opentrons robot before running the protocol.

Remember to simulate your protocol before running it to catch syntax errors and other issues using the Opentrons App or the command line interface (`opentrons_simulate`). More information on the Opentrons protocols and syntax can be found in the [Opentrons API documentation](https://docs.opentrons.com/).
