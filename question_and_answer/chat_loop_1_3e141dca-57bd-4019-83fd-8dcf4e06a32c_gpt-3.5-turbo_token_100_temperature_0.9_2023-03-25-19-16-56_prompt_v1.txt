prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Sure, here's a Python script that will perform the experiment you described using the Opentrons API:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Load the labware
tiprack_1000 = labware.load('opentrons_1000ul_tiprack', '1')
plate_6_well =  labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '4')
tube_rack = labware.load('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '5')

# Load the pipette
pipette = instruments.P1000_Single(mount='left', tip_racks=[tiprack_1000])

# Define the protocol steps
def run_protocol():
    # Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well use 1 ml of PBS(-).
    for well in plate_6_well.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.mix(5, 1000, tube_rack.wells(0))
        pipette.aspirate(1000, tube_rack.wells(0))
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.mix(5, 1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(1000, tube_rack.wells(1))
    pipette.dispense(1000, plate_6_well.wells('A1'))
    pipette.mix(5, 1000, plate_6_well.wells('A1'))
    pipette.drop_tip()

    robot.pause(minutes=5)

    # Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
    for well in plate_6_well.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.aspirate(1000, tube_rack.wells(2))
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.mix(5, 1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

# Run the protocol
run_protocol()
```

In this script, we first load the required labware (a tip rack, a 6-well plate, and a tube rack) using the Opentrons `labware.load` function, and create a pipette using the `instruments.P1000_Single` function.

Then, we define a series of protocol steps in the `run_protocol` function. These steps involve using the pipette to dispense and aspirate liquid from the various wells and tubes, and waiting for 5 minutes after adding the trypsin solution.

Finally, we call the `run_protocol` function to execute the protocol on the Opentrons robot.
