    This error message indicates that the Python protocol you created is not compatible with the current version of the Opentrons robot server. The protocol was created with Python API Version 1.0, and the current version of the robot server (4.0.0) no longer supports that version.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
It seems like the error is caused by a syntax issue in the Python protocol code. However, the error message includes extra text that is not relevant to the actual error message. Can you provide me with the actual Python protocol code that you are trying to run? That way I can try to help you debug the issue.
