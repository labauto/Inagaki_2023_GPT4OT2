prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
I understand that you want to write a Python script to control an Opentrons machine for automating a laboratory experiment to exchange hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6 well plate. Please note, you need to have the necessary hardware to perform this experiment.

Before starting, please make sure to install the "opentrons" module in your Python environment using:

```sh
pip install opentrons
```
Here's a Python script to perform the mentioned experiment:

```python
import opentrons.execute
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Cell Culture Medium Exchange',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6 well plate.'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware Configuration
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    6_well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')
    medium_tube = protocol.load_labware('eppendorf_5ml', '3')
    
    # Pipette Configuration
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])
    
    # Reagent Locations
    pbs_minus = medium_tube.wells_by_name()['A1']
    d_meme = medium_tube.wells_by_name()['A2']
    
    # Aspirate and Dispense Volumes
    pbs_aspirate_volume = 1000  # You can adjust this value based on your requirements
    d_meme_dispense_volume = 1000 # You can adjust this value based on your requirements
    
    # Remove Old Media and Add PBS(-)
    for well in 6_well_plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(pbs_aspirate_volume, pbs_minus)
        p300.dispense(pbs_aspirate_volume, well)
        p300.mix(3, pbs_aspirate_volume//2, well)  # Mix number of times, volume to mix
        p300.blow_out(well.top())  # Blow air in to push the liquid out
        p300.aspirate(pbs_aspirate_volume, well)  # Aspirate the mixed liquid
        p300.dispense(pbs_aspirate_volume, pbs_minus)  # Discard liquid into waste container
        p300.drop_tip()
    
    # Add D-MEM
    for well in 6_well_plate.wells():
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(d_meme_dispense_volume, d_meme)
        p300.dispense(d_meme_dispense_volume, well)
        p300.drop_tip()
```

Please note, you might need to adapt the code to the specific hardware configuration you're working with - this includes IDs of labware (e.g., 'opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', 'corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 'eppendorf_5ml') and the position of each device on the deck. Make sure to follow the documentation for your specific hardware, which can be found in the Opentrons Labware Library: https://labware.opentrons.com/

Adjust the variables "pbs_aspirate_volume" and "d_meme_dispense_volume" to the required volumes for your experiment.
