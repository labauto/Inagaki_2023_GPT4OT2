prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Here's a Python script for running an Opentrons robot to perform the desired laboratory experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Automated Laboratory Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'Wash 6 well plate, add trypsin solution and cell culture medium',
    'apiLevel': '2.0'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware setup
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 1)
    falcon_tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 2)
    wellplate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 3)

    # Pipette setup
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagent setup
    PBS_minus = falcon_tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin_solution = falcon_tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']
    DMEM = falcon_tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']

    # Protocol steps:
    # 1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.transfer(1000, PBS_minus, well.top(), mix_after=(5, 1000), new_tip='never')
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # 2. Add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.transfer(1000, trypsin_solution, well.top(), new_tip='never', mix_after=(1, 1000))
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # 3. Wait for 5 minutes
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # 4. Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.transfer(1000, DMEM, well.top(), new_tip='never', mix_after=(1, 1000))
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # 5. Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment('Experiment completed successfully.')
```

This script performs the described experiment. Please note that you can modify the labware placements, slots, and other instrument parameters as required in your setup.
