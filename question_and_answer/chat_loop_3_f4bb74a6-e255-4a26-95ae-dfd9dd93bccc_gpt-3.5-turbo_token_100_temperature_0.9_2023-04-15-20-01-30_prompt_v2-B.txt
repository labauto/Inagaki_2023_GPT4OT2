    Yes, I can help you. The error message suggests that the function `delay` doesn't accept the keyword argument `hours`. You can use `minutes` instead to specify the time.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
Certainly. It seems that there is a syntax error in your code. The error message suggests that the error is on the first line of your code. However, that line seems to be a comment and not an actual Python code. I suspect that you might have copy-pasted something that you shouldn't. 

Can you please share the exact code that you are running?
