prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Here is a Python script to automate your experiment following the protocol steps you described using the Opentrons API:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.9',
    'protocolName': 'Automated Lab Experiment',
    'description': 'Automated lab experiment using Opentrons',
    'author': 'Opentrons Helper'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 1)
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 2)
    tips = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 3)

    # Pipette
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', mount='right', tip_racks=[tips])

    # Reagents
    pbs_minus = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin_sol = tuberack.wells_by_name()['B1']
    dmem = tuberack.wells_by_name()['C1']

    # Protocol Steps

    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs_minus)
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
            p1000.aspirate(1000, well)
        p1000.return_tip()

    # Step 2: Add trypsin solution to the cell culture dish
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin_sol)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Wait for 5 minutes.
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add DMEM to the 6 well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, dmem)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment("Experiment completed!")
```

This script follows your protocol steps and uses the labware specified. Keep in mind that you should set up the labware according to the appropriate slots mentioned in the `load_labware` functions.
