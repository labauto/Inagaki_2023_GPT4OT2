I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Sure! Here is a Python script that should automate the experiment you described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Spheroid Culture',
    'author': 'Your Name Here',
    'description': 'This protocol automates the culture of hMSC spheroids',
    'apiLevel': '2.2'
}

# set up the deck on the robot
def deck_setup(protocol):
    tiprack_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    tiprack_10 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_10ul', '2')
    plate_96_osminus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '3')
    plate_96_osplus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '4')
    trough = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '5')

    return tiprack_200, tiprack_10, plate_96_osminus, plate_96_osplus, trough

# transfer DMEM to each well of the OS- plate
def transfer_dmem_osminus(protocol, plate, pipette):

    for row in plate.rows():
        pipette.transfer(100, trough['A1'], row, new_tip='always')


# transfer DMEM high glucose and supplements to each well of the OS+ plate
def transfer_media_osplus(protocol, plate, pipette):

    dexam = trough['A2']
    ascor = trough['A3']
    bgp = trough['A4']

    for row in plate.rows():
        pipette.transfer(100, trough['A1'], row, new_tip='always') # DMEM High Glucose
        pipette.transfer(0.1, dexam, row, new_tip='always') # Dexamethasone
        pipette.transfer(1, ascor, row, new_tip='always') # Ascorbic acid
        pipette.transfer(1, bgp, row, new_tip='always') # beta-Glycerophosphate


# transfer hMSC cells to each well of the plates
def transfer_cells(protocol, plate_osminus, plate_osplus, pipette):

    cell_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.32ml_flat', '6')

    cell_well = cell_plate['A1']
    for row_osminus, row_osplus in zip(plate_osminus.rows(), plate_osplus.rows()):
        pipette.transfer(100, cell_well, row_osminus, new_tip='always')
        pipette.transfer(100, cell_well, row_osplus, new_tip='always')


# main function
def run(protocol):
    # setup deck and pipettes
    tiprack_200, tiprack_10, plate_96_osminus, plate_96_osplus, trough = deck_setup(protocol)

    pipette_200 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack_200])
    pipette_10 = protocol.load_instrument('p10_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_10])

    # transfer DMEM to each well of the OS- plate
    transfer_dmem_osminus(protocol, plate_96_osminus, pipette_200)

    # transfer DMEM high glucose and supplements to each well of the OS+ plate
    transfer_media_osplus(protocol, plate_96_osplus, pipette_200)

    # transfer hMSC cells to each well of the plates
    transfer_cells(protocol, plate_96_osminus, plate_96_osplus, pipette_10)

``` 

You can copy and paste this into the Opentrons Protocol Designer software, and adjust it as necessary to fit your specific needs. 

Note that this script assumes that the Opentrons robot has already been set up and calibrated, and that the required labware and reagents have been loaded onto the deck in the specified locations.
