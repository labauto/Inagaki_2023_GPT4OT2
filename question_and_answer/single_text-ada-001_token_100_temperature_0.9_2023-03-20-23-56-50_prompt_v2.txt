I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************

#arovarsi.py

print("Cleaning the machine")

while True:

MSC(of=4) = MSC(of=5)

MSC(of=6) = MSC(of=7)

if MSC(of=6) > MSC(of=5):

MSC(of=6) = MSC(of=7)

MSC(of=7) = MSC(of=6)

break
