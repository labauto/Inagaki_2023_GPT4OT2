prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
To help you write the Python script for running the Opentrons machine following the given protocol, I'm providing the code below:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.10', 
    'protocolName': 'Automate Laboratory Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'A protocol to perform the given experiment steps on an Opentrons robot'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware setup
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 1)

    p1000_tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 2)
    
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 3)

    # Pipette setup
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[p1000_tiprack])
    
    # Reagents
    pbs_minus = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1'] 
    trypsin = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']
    dmem = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']
    
    # Protocol
    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs_minus)
            p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 mL of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()
        
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, dmem)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment (no actions needed)
```

Make sure to adjust any labware or pipettes to fit the specific configuration of your laboratory setup. This script assumes you have the necessary labware and pipettes. Run the script on the Opentrons app after connecting to your robot to execute the experiment.
