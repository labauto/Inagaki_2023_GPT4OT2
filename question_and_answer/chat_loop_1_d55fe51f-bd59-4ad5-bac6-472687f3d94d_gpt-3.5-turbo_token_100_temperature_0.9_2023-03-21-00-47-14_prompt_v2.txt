prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

Sure, here is an example Python script that uses the Opentrons API to perform the experiment as described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Set up the pipettes
    left_pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'left')
    right_pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right')

    # Set up the labware
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')
    reservoir = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '2')

    # Define the reagents
    pbs_neg = reservoir['A1']
    dmem = reservoir['A2']

    # Define the locations of the wells for the plate
    wells = [well for row in plate.rows() for well in row]

    # Distribute PBS(-) to wells
    left_pipette.pick_up_tip()
    for well in wells:
        left_pipette.aspirate(200, pbs_neg)
        left_pipette.dispense(200, well)
    left_pipette.drop_tip()

    # Exchange PBS(-) with D-MEM
    right_pipette.pick_up_tip()
    for well in wells:
        right_pipette.aspirate(200, well)
        right_pipette.dispense(200, reservoir['A3'])
    right_pipette.drop_tip()

    # Add D-MEM to wells
    left_pipette.pick_up_tip()
    for well in wells:
        left_pipette.aspirate(200, dmem)
        left_pipette.dispense(200, well)
    left_pipette.drop_tip()
```

This script uses the `opentrons` library to configure a protocol and control the robot. The `run` function is the main entry point for the script and is called by the Opentrons software to execute the protocol.

In this protocol, we first load the pipettes and labware that we will use for the experiment. We then define the reagents (PBS(-) and D-MEM) and the locations of the wells on the 6-well plate.

The script then uses the first pipette to distribute PBS(-) to each well on the plate, and the second pipette to exchange the PBS(-) with D-MEM. Finally, we use the first pipette again to add fresh D-MEM to each well.

Note that this script assumes that the robot has been properly calibrated and that the labware and reagents have been loaded in the correct positions. You may need to modify the script to suit your specific setup.
