I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

To write a Python script that runs an Opentrons machine for your experiment, you'll first need to install the Opentrons API. Make sure to follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.opentrons.com/) for installing the required dependencies and setting up the environment.

After setting up the required dependencies and environment, you can use the Opentrons API to write a Python script that performs the desired experiment. Here's an example script:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC Spheroids Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated lab experiment with Opentrons robot',
    'apiLevel': '2.11',
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware setup
    reagent_plate = protocol.load_labware('nest_12_reservoir_15ml', '1')
    os_minus_medium = reagent_plate.wells()[0]
    os_plus_medium = reagent_plate.wells()[1]
    dex = reagent_plate.wells()[2]
    aa = reagent_plate.wells()[3]
    bgp = reagent_plate.wells()[4]
    hmsc_cells = reagent_plate.wells()[5]
    os_minus_plate = protocol.load_labware('biorad_96_wellplate_200µl_pcr', '2')
    os_plus_plate = protocol.load_labware('biorad_96_wellplate_200µl_pcr', '3')

    # Pipette setup
    p200 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'left', tip_racks=[protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_filtertiprack_200µl', '5')])
    p20 = protocol.load_instrument('p20_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_filtertiprack_20µl', '4')])

    # Transferring medium to 96 well plates
    p200.distribute(100, os_minus_medium, os_minus_plate.wells())
    p200.distribute(100, os_plus_medium, os_plus_plate.wells())

    # Adding supplements to OS+ plate
    p20.transfer(0.1, dex, os_plus_plate.wells(), mix_before=(3, 20), mix_after=(3, 20))
    p200.transfer(1, aa, os_plus_plate.wells(), mix_before=(3, 100), mix_after=(3, 100))
    p200.transfer(1, bgp, os_plus_plate.wells(), mix_before=(3, 100), mix_after=(3, 100))

    # Transferring hMSC cells to 96 well plates
    p200.distribute(100, hmsc_cells, os_minus_plate.wells())
    p200.distribute(100, hmsc_cells, os_plus_plate.wells())

    # End of the protocol
    protocol.comment('Experiment completed.')
```

This script assumes the required labware and pipettes are available for use with the Opentrons robot. Be sure to adjust the labware and pipette models to match your specific setup. The script uses a reagent plate for medium and reagents, and two 96 well plates for OS(-) and OS(+) conditions. The pipettes used in this example are p200 and p20 for transferring medium/reagents and cells, respectively.

Remember to verify that the API version specified in the metadata {'apiLevel': '2.11'} is compatible with the apiLevel of your Opentrons software.
