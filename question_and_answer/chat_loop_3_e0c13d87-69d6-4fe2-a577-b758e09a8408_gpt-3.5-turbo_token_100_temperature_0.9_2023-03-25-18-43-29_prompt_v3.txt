 I got this error: ```python

    I don't see the full script, but based on the error message it seems like there might be an issue with the syntax on line 76 of the script. You can't use the `*` syntax to unpack a list in a for loop like that. Instead you can use `itertools.chain` to concatenate the lists together. Here's what it should look like:
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
I don't see the full script, so it's hard to say exactly what the issue is. However, based on the error message it seems like there might be an issue with the syntax on line 1 of the script where it says "I don't see the full script". This is not valid Python code and needs to be removed.
