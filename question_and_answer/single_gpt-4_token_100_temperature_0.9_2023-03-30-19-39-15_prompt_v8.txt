I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Here is a Python script that utilizes the Opentrons API to automate your laboratory experiment. The code is split into multiple functions to fulfill each step of the experiment:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    dmem_container = protocol.load_labware('nest_1_reservoir_195ml', '1')
    dmem_high_glucose_container = protocol.load_labware('nest_1_reservoir_195ml', '2')
    hmsc_container = protocol.load_labware('nest_1_reservoir_195ml', '3')
    plate_os_negative = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate', '5')
    plate_os_positive = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate', '6')

    supplements_container = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_nest_1.5ml_snapcap', '4')
    dex = supplements_container['A1']
    aa = supplements_container['B1']
    bgp = supplements_container['C1']

    # Pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single_gen2', 'right')
    p10 = protocol.load_instrument('p10_single_gen2', 'left')

    # Functions
    def transfer_medium(pipette, source_medium, destination_plate, volume):
        for well in destination_plate.wells():
            pipette.transfer(volume, source_medium, well)

    def add_supplements(pipette, supplements, destination_plate, volumes):
        for well in destination_plate.wells():
            for supplement, volume in zip(supplements, volumes):
                pipette.transfer(volume, supplement, well)

    def transfer_cells(pipette, source_cells, destination_plate, volume):
            for well in destination_plate.wells():
                pipette.transfer(volume, source_cells, well)

    # Main Function
    transfer_medium(p1000, dmem_container['A1'], plate_os_negative, 100) # OS- DMEM transfer
    transfer_medium(p1000, dmem_high_glucose_container['A1'], plate_os_positive, 100) # OS+ DMEM High Glucose transfer
    add_supplements(p10, [dex, aa, bgp], plate_os_positive, [0.1, 1, 1]) # Add supplements to OS+ wells
    transfer_cells(p1000, hmsc_container['A1'], plate_os_negative, 100) # Transfer hMSC to OS- wells
    transfer_cells(p1000, hmsc_container['A1'], plate_os_positive, 100) # Transfer hMSC to OS+ wells
```

This script assumes that you have the appropriate labware definitions available within your Opentrons library. Make sure to have the necessary labware modules installed on your system.

Please note that the script has been written for Opentrons API version 2.10. If you have a different API version, change the API level in the 'metadata' variable accordingly.
