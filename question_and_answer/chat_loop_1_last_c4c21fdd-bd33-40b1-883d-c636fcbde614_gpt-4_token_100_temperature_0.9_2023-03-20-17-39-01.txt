prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

Below is the Python script for running the Opentrons machine according to the given protocol steps:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Automate Laboratory Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labware and Pipettes
    tiprack_1000 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
    pipette_1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_1000])
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')

    # Reagents
    PBS = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']
    DMEM = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']
    
    # Steps

    # Step 1: Wash the 6-well plate with 1 ml of PBS(-)
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.aspirate(1000, PBS)
        for _ in range(5):
            pipette_1000.dispense(1000, well)
            pipette_1000.aspirate(1000, well)
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 mL of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        pipette_1000.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6-well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette_1000.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_1000.aspirate(1000, DMEM)
        pipette_1000.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette_1000.drop_tip()

    # Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment('The experiment is now complete.')
```

This script follows the specified protocol steps and uses appropriate labware and pipettes. Keep in mind that you'll need to set up the Opentrons machine and input the correct information in the Opentrons App for the script to run correctly.
