prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Sure, here's some code that will prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes using the Opentrons machine:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Load labware
plate_6well = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8_ml_flat', '1')

tip_rack_10 = labware.load('tiprack-10ul', '2')
tip_rack_300 = labware.load('tiprack-200ul', '3')

buffer = labware.load('96-deep-well', '4')

# Load pipettes
p10 = instruments.P10_Single(mount='right', tip_racks=[tip_rack_10])
p300 = instruments.P300_Single(mount='left', tip_racks=[tip_rack_300])

# Define incubation times
WASH_TIME = 30

# Define reagents and volumes
primary_antibody = buffer.wells('A1')
secondary_antibody = buffer.wells('A2')
wash_buffer1 = buffer.columns('3')[0]
wash_buffer2 = buffer.columns('4')[0]
mounting_medium = buffer.wells('H1')

# Define well coordinates for each step
cell_wells = plate_6well.rows('A')[:6]
primary_ab_wells = plate_6well.rows('B')[:6]
secondary_ab_wells = plate_6well.rows('C')[:6]
wash1_wells = plate_6well.rows('D')[:6]
wash2_wells = plate_6well.rows('E')[:6]
mounting_wells = plate_6well.rows('F')[:6]

# Dispense primary antibody and incubate
for well in primary_ab_wells:
    p10.pick_up_tip()
    p10.transfer(2, primary_antibody, well, new_tip='never')
    p10.mix(3, 10, well)
    p10.drop_tip()

robot.pause('Incubate for 1 hour at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Then remove media and wash cells twice with 1x PBS. Add 2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Then wash cells once more with 1x PBS.')

# Dispense secondary antibody and incubate
for well in secondary_ab_wells:
    p10.pick_up_tip()
    p10.transfer(2, secondary_antibody, well, new_tip='never')
    p10.mix(3, 10, well)
    p10.drop_tip()

robot.pause(f'Incubate {WASH_TIME} sec at room temperature. Then remove media and wash cells three times with 1x PBS. Prepare mounting medium.')

# Dispense wash buffer 1
for well in wash1_wells:
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.transfer(300, wash_buffer1, well, new_tip='never')
    p300.mix(3, 200, well)
    p300.drop_tip()

robot.pause(f'Incubate {WASH_TIME} sec at room temperature. Remove washing buffer 1.')

# Dispense wash buffer 2
for well in wash2_wells:
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.transfer(300, wash_buffer2, well, new_tip='never')
    p300.mix(3, 200, well)
    p300.drop_tip()

robot.pause(f'Incubate {WASH_TIME} sec at room temperature. Remove washing buffer 2.')

# Dispense mounting medium
for well in mounting_wells:
    p300.pick_up_tip()
    p300.transfer(100, mounting_medium, well, new_tip='never')
    p300.mix(3, 70, well)
    p300.drop_tip()

robot.pause('Cover wells to prevent evaporation and image appropriate channels with fluorescence microscope.')

``` 

This script assumes that the Opentrons machine has been properly calibrated and the labware has been loaded onto it. This script also uses a pause function to allow you to perform certain steps manually, such as incubation and washing, which are not automatable with the Opentrons machine. Finally, this script provides general guidelines for immunostaining hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes, but these guidelines may need to be modified for specific experimental setups.
