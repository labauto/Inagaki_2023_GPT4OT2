    I'm sorry, but I cannot see the code that produced the error you posted. It seems like the error message itself was written as code and produced a syntax error. If you can provide the original code that produced the error, I would be happy to take a look and try to help you fix it.

SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
