prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
Certainly! Here's an example Python script that uses the Opentrons API to prepare immunostained hMSC cells for visualization of lysosomes:

```
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Load the labware
plate = labware.load('6-well-plate', '1')

# Define the instruments
pipette = instruments.P300_Single(mount='left')

# Define the reagents
primary_antibody = 'A647-conjugated anti-lysosome antibody'
secondary_antibody = 'FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG'
DAPI_stain = 'DAPI nuclear stain'

# Define the volumes for each step
primary_volume = 50
secondary_volume = 50
DAPI_volume = 10

# Define the positions of the cells in the plate
cell_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(1, 7) for j in range(1, 3)]

# Function to add reagents to cells
def add_reagents_to_cells(cell_position):
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(primary_volume, primary_antibody)
    pipette.dispense(primary_volume, plate.cell(cell_position).top())
    pipette.aspirate(secondary_volume, secondary_antibody)
    pipette.dispense(secondary_volume, plate.cell(cell_position).top())
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Function to add DAPI stain to cells
def add_dapi_to_cells(cell_position):
    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    pipette.aspirate(DAPI_volume, DAPI_stain)
    pipette.dispense(DAPI_volume, plate.cell(cell_position).bottom())
    pipette.touch_tip()
    pipette.drop_tip()

# Move the robot to the home position
robot.home()

# Add primary and secondary antibodies to the cells
for cell_position in cell_positions:
    add_reagents_to_cells(cell_position)

# Add DAPI stain to the cells
for cell_position in cell_positions:
    add_dapi_to_cells(cell_position)

# Move the robot back to the home position
robot.home()
```

This script assumes that you have a 6-well plate loaded on slot 1 of your Opentrons machine, and that your antibodies and DAPI stain are loaded into compatible labware on the other slots. Replace the variables `primary_antibody`, `secondary_antibody`, `DAPI_stain`, and `cell_positions` with your own reagents and cell positions, and adjust the volumes as necessary for your experiment.
