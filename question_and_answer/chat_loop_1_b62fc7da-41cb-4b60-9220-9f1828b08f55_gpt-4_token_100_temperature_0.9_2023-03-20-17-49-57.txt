prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

To write the Python script to run the Opentrons machine, you can use the following code. This code assumes you have the Opentrons API and necessary modules installed. For more information, visit https://docs.opentrons.com/.

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11',
    'protocolName': 'Automate Laboratory Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'Automate laboratory experiment using the Opentrons machine'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Labwares
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 1)
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 2)
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 3)

    # Pipettes
    p1000 = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagents
    pbs = tuberack.wells('A1')
    trypsin = tuberack.wells('A2')
    dmem = tuberack.wells('A3')

    # Protocol Steps

    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, pbs)
        for _ in range(5):
            p1000.dispense(800, well).aspirate(800, well)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.blow_out()
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, trypsin)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.blow_out()
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Waiting for 5 minutes (incubation period)
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in plate.wells():
        p1000.pick_up_tip()
        p1000.aspirate(1000, dmem)
        p1000.dispense(1000, well)
        p1000.blow_out()
        p1000.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment (Done)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from opentrons import simulate
    protocol = simulate.get_protocol_api('2.11')
    run(protocol)
```

This script will perform the experiment following the protocol steps mentioned in your question. Make sure to adjust the labware and pipette names as well as their positions on the deck accordingly.
