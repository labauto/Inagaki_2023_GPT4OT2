prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

To run the desired experiment, you can use the following Python script using the Opentrons API:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.10',
    'protocolName': 'Automated Lab Experiment',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated lab experiment using Opentrons'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # Load Labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', 1)
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', 2)
    wellplate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 3)

    # Load Pipette
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # Reagent Locations
    pbs_minus = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin_solution = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']
    cell_culture_medium = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']

    # Protocol Steps

    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):
            pipette.aspirate(1000, pbs_minus)
            pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.aspirate(1000, trypsin_solution)
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()
    protocol.delay(minutes=5)

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in wellplate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.aspirate(1000, cell_culture_medium)
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment
    protocol.comment('Experiment finished successfully!')
```

This script should be executed in your Opentrons robot's environment to perform the desired experiment.
