prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

# Import necessary packages
from opentrons import robot, labware, instruments

# Define labware
tuberack = labware.load('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '1')
wellplate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')

# Define pipette
pipette = instruments.P1000_Single(
    mount='left',
    tip_racks=[tuberack['C1']])

# Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('A1'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('A2'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('A3'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('B1'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('B2'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['A1'],
    wellplate.wells('B3'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

# Step 2: After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['B1'],
    wellplate.wells('A1', to='B3'),
    mix_after=(5, 1),
    new_tip='always'
)

# Step 3: Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
pipette.transfer(1,
    tuberack['C1'],
    wellplate.wells('A1', to='B3'),
    new_tip='always'
)

# Step 4: Finish the experiment.
robot.home()
