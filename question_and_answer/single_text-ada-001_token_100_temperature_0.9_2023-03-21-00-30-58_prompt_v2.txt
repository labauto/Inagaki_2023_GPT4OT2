prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.


###



answer:*************************

# Enter the name of the machine
pandas.opentrons.MachineName = "Opentrons"

# Get the current culture
opentrons.Culture = "PBS(-)!"

# Change the culture media
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Get the current Experiment ID
opentrons. ExperimentID = ":"

# Change the inputmedia
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Get the current outputmedia
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Change the inputuse
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Change the outputuse
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Get the current software
opentrons.Software = "PBS(-)!"

# Change the inputin
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Change the outputin
opentrons.Culture { # change the media to suit # }

# Get the current inputdata
opentrons. inputData = "Gruyère grise"

# Get the current outputdata
opentrons. outputData = "Gruyère grise"
