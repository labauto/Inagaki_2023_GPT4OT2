prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Sure, here's a Python script that does the experiment you described. The script assumes that the Opentrons machine is connected and set up correctly:

```
from opentrons import robot, instruments

# Define constants
WELL_PLATE_96 = '96-well-plate'
WELL_PLATE_6 = '6-well-plate'
VOL_MEDIUM = 100  # µl
VOL_SUBSTANCES = 0.1, 1, 1  # Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, beta-glycerophosphate
VOL_CELLS = 100  # µl
NUM_CELLS = 2500  # cells/100 µl

def transfer_medium(dispense_plate, volume):
    # Transfer medium to each well of dispense_plate
    pipette.distribute(volume, medium_source.bottom(), [well.bottom() for well in dispense_plate.wells()])

def add_substances(dispense_plate, substances, volume):
    # Add substances to each well of dispense_plate
    pipette.distribute(volume, [substance_source.bottom() for substance_source in substances], [well.bottom() for well in dispense_plate.wells()])

def transfer_cells(dispense_plate, volume, num_cells):
    # Transfer cells to each well of dispense_plate
    pipette.distribute(volume, cell_source.bottom(), [well.bottom() for well in dispense_plate.wells()], new_tip='always')
    # Calculate the volume of cells to pipette based on num_cells, and pipette that amount
    for well in dispense_plate.wells():
        if well.volume > 0:
            num_cells_pipetted = round(well.volume / VOL_CELLS * NUM_CELLS)
            if num_cells_pipetted > num_cells:
                pipette.aspirate(well.volume - volume, well.bottom())
                pipette.dispense(well.volume - volume, waste)
                num_cells_pipetted = num_cells
            else:
                volume_to_pipette = num_cells / NUM_CELLS * VOL_CELLS
                pipette.aspirate(volume_to_pipette, cell_source.bottom())
                pipette.dispense(volume_to_pipette, well.bottom())
            num_cells -= num_cells_pipetted

def main():
    # Set up robot and labware
    robot.disconnect()
    robot.connect()
    robot.home()
    medium_source = instruments.Slot(1).from_labware(WellPlate_6)
    substance_sources = [instrumets.Slot(i).from_labware(WellPlate_6, index=2+j) for j in range(3)]
    cell_source = instruments.Slot(4).from_labware(WellPlate_6)
    waste = instruments.Slot(12).from_labware('trough-12row', well='A12')
    os_minus_dispense_plate = instruments.Slot(7).from_labware(WELL_PLATE_96)
    os_plus_dispense_plate = instruments.Slot(8).from_labware(WELL_PLATE_96)

    # Set up pipette
    pipette = instruments.P1000_Single(
        tip_racks=[instruments.Slot(5).from_labware('opentrons-tiprack-1000ul', label='tiprack-1000-1')],
        trash_container=waste,
        aspirate_flow_rate=300,
        dispense_flow_rate=300,
        tip_pick_up_distance=5,
        tip_drop_distance=2
    )

    # Perform the experiment
    transfer_medium(os_minus_dispense_plate, VOL_MEDIUM)
    transfer_medium(os_plus_dispense_plate, VOL_MEDIUM)
    add_substances(os_plus_dispense_plate, substance_sources, VOL_SUBSTANCES)
    transfer_cells(os_minus_dispense_plate, VOL_CELLS, NUM_CELLS)
    transfer_cells(os_plus_dispense_plate, VOL_CELLS, NUM_CELLS)

    # Disconnect robot
    robot.disconnect()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script defines several functions that perform each step of the experiment, such as `transfer_medium` and `add_substances`. These functions take as input the destination plate (either the OS- or OS+ plate), the volume of liquid to dispense, and any additional substances to add to the OS+ plate. The function `transfer_cells` takes an additional input, `num_cells`, which specifies the number of cells to transfer for each well.

The `main` function sets up the robot and labware, defines the pipette, and calls the helper functions in order to perform the experiment. Finally, it disconnects the robot.

Note that the script is written for the Opentrons OT-2 and may need to be adapted for a different robot model.
