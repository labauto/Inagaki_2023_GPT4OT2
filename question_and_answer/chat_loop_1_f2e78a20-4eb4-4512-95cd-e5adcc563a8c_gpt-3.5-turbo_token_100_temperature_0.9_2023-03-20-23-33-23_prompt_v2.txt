prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
Sure, here's a Python script that controls an Opentrons robot to exchange the medium of hMSC cell culture between PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6-well plate:

```python
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Define labware
plate = labware.load('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '1')

p200 = instruments.Pipette(
    name='p200',
    trash_container=plate,
    tip_racks=[],
    min_volume=20,
    max_volume=200,
    axis="a",
)

# Define columns and wells to be used
wells = [well for row in plate.rows() for well in row]
PBS_wells = wells[0:3]
DMEM_wells = wells[3:]

# Define volumes
PBS_volume = 200  # uL
DMEM_volume = 500  # uL

# Exchanging media
robot.comment("Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM")
for i in range(2):
    # Dispense PBS into wells
    p200.distribute(
        PBS_volume,
        PBS_wells,
        disposal_volume=20
    )
    robot.pause("Incubate for 5 minutes")
    # Remove PBS from wells
    p200.transfer(
        200,
        PBS_wells,
        plate['A1'].top(),
        disposal_volume=20,
        new_tip='always'
    )
    # Dispense DMEM into wells
    p200.distribute(
        DMEM_volume,
        DMEM_wells,
        disposal_volume=20
    )
    robot.pause("Incubate for 30 minutes")
    # Remove DMEM from wells
    p200.transfer(
        500,
        DMEM_wells,
        plate['A1'].top(),
        disposal_volume=20,
        new_tip='always'
    )
```

This script loads a 6-well plate, sets up a pipette, defines volumes of PBS and DMEM, and proceeds to exchange the media by following these steps:

1. Dispense PBS into the first 3 wells
2. Incubate the plate for 5 minutes
3. Remove PBS from the wells
4. Dispense DMEM into the first 3 wells
5. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes
6. Remove DMEM from the wells
7. Repeat steps 1-6 with the last 3 wells.

You can modify the script as needed to fit your specific experimental setup or preferences.
