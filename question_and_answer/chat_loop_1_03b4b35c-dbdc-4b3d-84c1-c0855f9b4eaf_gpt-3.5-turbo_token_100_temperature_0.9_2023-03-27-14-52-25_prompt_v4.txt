I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End
    
answer:*************************
Sure, here's a Python script that runs the Opentrons machine and performs the experiment you described:

```
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'hMSC spheroid culture',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Spheroid culture of hMSC cells on 96-well plates using Opentrons robot',
}

# define the transfer function
def transfer(volume, source, dest):
    pipette.aspirate(volume, source)
    pipette.dispense(volume, dest)

# define the protocol
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    
    # labware
    plate_96_os_minus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '1')
    plate_96_os_plus = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '2')
    plate_6_cells = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')
    tiprack_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '5')
    
    # pipettes
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack_200])
    
    # transfer 100 µl of medium to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
    for well in plate_96_os_minus.rows()[0]:
        transfer(100, plate_6_cells['A1'], well)
    
    # transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) and supplements to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
    for well in plate_96_os_plus.rows()[0]:
        transfer(100, plate_6_cells['A1'], well)
        transfer(0.1, plate_6_cells['B1'], well)
        transfer(1, plate_6_cells['C1'], well)
        transfer(1, plate_6_cells['D1'], well)
    
    # transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells to each well of 96 well plate (OS-) and (OS+)
    for well in plate_96_os_minus.rows()[0]:
        transfer(100, plate_6_cells['E1'], well)
    
    for well in plate_96_os_plus.rows()[0]:
        transfer(100, plate_6_cells['E1'], well)
    
    # end
    protocol.comment("Protocol completed!")
```
Note: This script is written for the Opentrons API version 2. You may need to modify it slightly if you're using a newer version of the API.
