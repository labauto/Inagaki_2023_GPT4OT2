prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
To write and execute a Python script for running an Opentrons machine, you will need to have access to their API, which can be found at https://docs.opentrons.com/. In addition, you should have the Opentrons App installed on your computer and have access to an OT-2 Robot to run the protocol.

Now, let's write a Python script for automating your experiment: preparing immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes in a 6-well plate.

You will need the following lab materials:
1. hMSC cells
2. 6-well plates
3. Immunostaining reagents, including primary and secondary antibodies
4. Liquid handling supplies (pipettes, tips, etc.)

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'Immunostaining hMSC Cells',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Protocol for immunostaining of hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes in a 6-well plate.',
    'apiLevel': '2.10'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    
    # Load labware
    plate_6well = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', 1)
    tiprack_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', 2)
    tube_rack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_generic_2ml_screwcap', 3)

    # Load pipettes
    pipette_p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_200])
    
    # Reagents
    primary_antibody = tube_rack['A1']
    secondary_antibody = tube_rack['A2']
    wash_buffer = tube_rack['A3']

    # Variables
    incubation_time_primary = 60    # in minutes
    incubation_time_secondary = 60  # in minutes
    wash_steps = 3

    # Begin immunostaining process

    # Primary antibody incubation
    for well in plate_6well.wells():
        pipette_p300.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_p300.transfer(100, primary_antibody, well, mix_after=(3, 100), new_tip='never')
        pipette_p300.drop_tip()
    protocol.delay(minutes=incubation_time_primary)

    # Washing steps
    for _ in range(wash_steps):
        for well in plate_6well.wells():
            pipette_p300.pick_up_tip()
            pipette_p300.transfer(200, wash_buffer, well, mix_after=(3, 100), new_tip='never')
            pipette_p300.drop_tip()
    
    # Secondary antibody incubation
    for well in plate_6well.wells():
        pipette_p300.pick_up_tip()
        pipette_p300.transfer(100, secondary_antibody, well, mix_after=(3, 100), new_tip='never')
        pipette_p300.drop_tip()
    protocol.delay(minutes=incubation_time_secondary)

    # Final washing steps
    for _ in range(wash_steps):
        for well in plate_6well.wells():
            pipette_p300.pick_up_tip()
            pipette_p300.transfer(200, wash_buffer, well, mix_after=(3, 100), new_tip='never')
            pipette_p300.drop_tip()

    # Immunostaining process completed
```

This script covers the primary and secondary antibody incubations, with washing steps in between. You'll need to have your hMSC cells already cultured in the 6-well plate prior to beginning this automation. After running this script on the Opentrons App, your cells will be immunostained and ready for analysis.

Don't forget to update the labware and pipettes according to your experimental setup.
