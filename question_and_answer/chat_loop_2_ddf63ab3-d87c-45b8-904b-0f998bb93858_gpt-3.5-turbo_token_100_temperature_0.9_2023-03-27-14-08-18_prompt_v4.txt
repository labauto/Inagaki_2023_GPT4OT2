 I got this error: ```python

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
It seems that the well name 'C1' is not found in the source plate. Please check if the name of the well is correct and if it exists in the source plate.

You can also check if the API version is correct in the script. Please make sure that you are using Opentrons API version 2 or 3. Sometimes, using a different version can cause errors. 

If you still encounter the error after checking the well name and API version, please try providing more information about your setup and code so that we can assist you better.
