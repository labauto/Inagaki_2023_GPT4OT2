    This error looks like it's being raised from a script you've written. The syntax error suggests that there is a problem on line one of the Python script, which may be due to an error in the formatting or keywords used. To fix this error, you'll need to look at the code you've written and see what's causing the problem. 
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```, can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script. If you don't know how to fix it, say 'I don't know'.
answer:*************************
I'm sorry, but without seeing the code that you are running, I cannot determine the cause of the error. Please share your Python script with me, and I can help you troubleshoot the issue.
