prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Prepare immunostained hMSC cells to visualize lysosomes.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.
    
answer:*************************
To perform the experiment using the Opentrons OT-2 robot, you'll first need to install the Opentrons Python API by following the instructions provided on this page: https://docs.opentrons.com/

Assuming you have the necessary labware (pipettes, tips, and 6 well plate) and reagents (immunostaining reagents), here's an example script to automate the preparation of immunostained hMSC cells using the Opentrons Python API:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'ImmunoStaining of hMSC Cells',
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'description': 'Automated cell preparation to visualize lysosomes in hMSC cells',
    'apiLevel': '2.7'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack_300 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    six_well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '2')

    # Pipettes
    p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single_gen2', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack_300])

    # Wells in the 6-well plate (assuming four wells are filled with hMSC cells)
    wells = ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4']

    # Reagents (assuming you have fixed and permeabilized cells)
    immunostain_solution = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_15_tuberack_falcon_15ml_conical', '3')
    staining = immunostain_solution.wells_by_name()['A1']

    wash_solution = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_15_tuberack_falcon_15ml_conical', '4')
    wash = wash_solution.wells_by_name()['A2']

    # Perform the immunostaining experiment
    for well in wells:
        # Pipette the staining solution into the well
        p300.pick_up_tip()
        p300.aspirate(100, staining)
        p300.dispense(100, six_well_plate.wells_by_name()[well])
        p300.blow_out()
        p300.drop_tip()

        # Incubate for desired time (e.g., 1 hour) at room temperature in the dark
        protocol.delay(minutes = 60)

        # Wash the wells
        for wash_round in range(3):
            p300.pick_up_tip()
            p300.aspirate(200, wash)
            p300.dispense(200, six_well_plate.wells_by_name()[well])
            p300.blow_out()
            p300.drop_tip()

            # Incubate for desired time (e.g., 5 minutes) at room temperature
            protocol.delay(minutes = 5)
``` 

Please make sure to provide the correct labware and reagents in the script.

Please remember that this script may require adjustments based on the specifics of your experiment, such as reagent volumes, incubation times, etc. If you need assistance with specific steps, consult the Opentrons API documentation or seek help from the Opentrons community.
