    Certainly. It seems that there is a syntax error in your code. The error message suggests that the error is on the first line of your code. However, that line seems to be a comment and not an actual Python code. I suspect that you might have copy-pasted something that you shouldn't. 
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
Certainly. It looks like the error message is caused by a comment in the first line of the code. You can remove the comment or make sure that it is properly formatted as a comment so that the interpreter doesn't try to execute it as code. Here is an example script that prepares immunostained human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to visualize lysosomes using an Opentrons machine:

```
# Import the Opentrons API
import opentrons

# Create a connection to the robot
robot = opentrons.connect()

# Load a protocol onto the robot
protocol = robot.load_protocol('path/to/protocol')

# Set the number of wells in the culture plate
num_wells = 6

# Set the time for primary antibody incubation (in minutes)
primary_antibody_time = 60

# Transfer hMSCs to the 6-well plate with sterile pipette tips
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=500, 
        source='source_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 200)
    )

# Add primary antibody and incubate
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=100, 
        source='primary_antibody_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 50)
    )
    protocol.delay(minutes=primary_antibody_time)

# Wash with PBS
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=500, 
        source='PBS_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 200)
    )

# Add secondary antibody and incubate
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=100, 
        source='secondary_antibody_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 50)
    )
    protocol.delay(minutes=30)

# Wash with PBS again
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=500, 
        source='PBS_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 200)
    )

# Add DAPI and incubate
for well_idx in range(num_wells):
    protocol.transfer(
        volume=100, 
        source='DAPI_tube', 
        destination=f'culture_plate/{well_idx}',
        mix_before=(3, 50)
    )
    protocol.delay(minutes=10)

# Move the plate to a microscope and image the lysosomes
```


Note that in the code, you will need to replace the `'path/to/protocol'` string with the actual path to your protocol. You will also need to replace the `'source_tube'`, `'primary_antibody_tube'`, `'PBS_tube'`, `'secondary_antibody_tube'`, and `'DAPI_tube'` strings with the actual names of your reagent tubes.
