I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

To begin, let's install the Opentrons Python API by running `pip install opentrons`. Then you can use the following Python script to automate the experiment as described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11'
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tips_10 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_10ul', 1)
    tips_200 = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_200ul', 2)
    well_plate_96 = protocol.load_labware('nest_96_wellplate_200ul_flat', 3)
    reagent_tubes = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_1.5mL_single', 4)

    # Pipettes
    p10 = protocol.load_instrument('p10_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tips_10])
    p200 = protocol.load_instrument('p200_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tips_200])

    # Reagents
    high_glucose_dmem = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A1']
    dmem = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A2']
    dexamethasone = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A3']
    ascorbic_acid = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A4']
    beta_glycerophosphate = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A5']
    hmsc_cells = reagent_tubes.wells_by_name()['A6']

    # Destinations
    os_plus_wells = well_plate_96.columns_by_name()["1"]
    os_minus_wells = well_plate_96.columns_by_name()["2"]

    # Helper functions
    def transfer_medium(pipette, source, dest_wells):
        for well in dest_wells:
            pipette.transfer(100, source, well, new_tip='always')

    def add_os_plus_supplements(dest_wells):
        for well in dest_wells:
            p10.transfer(0.1, dexamethasone, well, mix_after=(3, 3), new_tip='always')
            p10.transfer(1, ascorbic_acid, well, mix_after=(3, 3), new_tip='always')
            p10.transfer(1, beta_glycerophosphate, well, mix_after=(3, 3), new_tip='always')

    def transfer_hmsc_cells(pipette, source, dest_wells):
        for well in dest_wells:
            pipette.transfer(100, source, well, new_tip='always')

    # Main function
    def main():
        # Transfer medium
        transfer_medium(p200, dmem, os_minus_wells)
        transfer_medium(p200, high_glucose_dmem, os_plus_wells)

        # Add supplements
        add_os_plus_supplements(os_plus_wells)

        # Transfer cells
        transfer_hmsc_cells(p200, hmsc_cells, os_minus_wells)
        transfer_hmsc_cells(p200, hmsc_cells, os_plus_wells)

    main()
```

This script defines the Opentrons API protocol context and labware, pipettes, and reagents used in the experiment. It then defines helper functions for transferring medium, adding supplements, and transferring hMSC cells. Finally, it combines the helper functions in the main function to automate the described experiment.
