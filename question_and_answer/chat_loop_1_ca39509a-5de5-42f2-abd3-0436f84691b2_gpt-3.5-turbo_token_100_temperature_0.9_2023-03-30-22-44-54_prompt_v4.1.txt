I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

We are cultureing hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) with DMEM in 6 well plates, and we want to make hMSC spheroids (2,500 cells) in 96 well plates with two different conditions, 1) With osteoinduction supplements (OS+) and 2) Without osteoinduction supplements (OS-). For osteoinduction supplements, we use Dexamethasone, Ascorbic acid, and beta-glycerophosphate.


For OS(-)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM) each well
For OS(+)
- use 100 µl medium (DMEM high glucose) each well and add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well.

Write a Python script that does the following:
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of medium (DMEM high glucose) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Add 0.1 µl of Dex (Dexamethasone), 1 µl of AA (Ascorbic acid), and 1 µl of BGP (beta-glycerophosphate) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS-)
- Transfer 100 µl of hMSC cells (2,500 cells/100 µl) to each well of 96 well plate (OS+)
- End

Mmake sure that if the code is long, split the code into multiple tiny functions and use it later in the main function. Ideally, split the experiment into multiple steps, and for each step, write a function that does the step. And then, call the function in the main function.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a Python script that runs the experiment you described:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.9'
}

# protocol run function
def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):

    # function to transfer 100 µl of medium to each well
    def transfer_medium(volume, source, dest):
        pipette.transfer(volume, source, dest, new_tip='always')
    
    # function to add supplements to the OS+ wells
    def add_supplements():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        for well in os_plus_wells:
            pipette.aspirate(0.1, dex)
            pipette.dispense(0.1, well)
            pipette.aspirate(1, aa)
            pipette.dispense(1, well)
            pipette.aspirate(1, bgp)
            pipette.dispense(1, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # create and set pipette
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'right', tip_racks=[protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', slot) for slot in ['1', '4']])
    pipette.flow_rate.aspirate = 25
    pipette.flow_rate.dispense = 50

    # load labwares
    cell_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '2', 'cell plate')
    os_minus_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '3', 'OS- plate')
    os_plus_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '5', 'OS+ plate')
    
    # get the target wells
    os_minus_wells = [well for well in os_minus_plate.wells() if well.has_empty_tip]
    os_plus_wells = [well for well in os_plus_plate.wells() if well.has_empty_tip]

    # get the reagents
    dex = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap', '6', 'Dex').wells()[0]
    aa = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap', '7', 'AA').wells()[0]
    bgp = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_24_tuberack_eppendorf_2ml_safelock_snapcap', '8', 'BGP').wells()[0]

    # transfer medium to the OS- wells
    transfer_medium(100, cell_plate.wells(), os_minus_wells)
    
    # transfer medium to the OS+ wells and add supplements
    transfer_medium(100, cell_plate.wells(), os_plus_wells)
    add_supplements()

    # transfer cells to the plates
    transfer_medium(100, cell_plate.wells(), os_minus_wells + os_plus_wells)
```

This code defines three functions that perform the three main steps in the experiment: transferring medium to the wells, adding supplements to the OS+ wells, and transferring cells to the plates. These functions are called in the main `run()` function, which also creates and sets the pipette, loads the labware and reagents, and defines the target wells.

You can run this script using the Opentrons app or the command line interface. To run it from the command line, save the script as a .py file and navigate to its directory. Then run `opentrons_simulate script.py` to simulate the run or `opentrons_execute script.py` to execute it on the robot. 

I hope this helps you get started with writing Python scripts for the Opentrons machine!
