prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a script that does the following experiment?

Protocol Steps:
1. Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-) by pipetting up and down 5 times. For each well, use 1 ml of PBS(-).
2. After washing, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%) to the cell culture dish and wait for 5 minutes.
3. Then, add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate.
4. Finish the experiment.

Possible Labware and Pipettes (Note that you don't need to trust these items, you can use any labware and pipette you want):
1. `opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical`
2. `p1000_single`
3. `corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat`

When writing scripts, be aware of the following:
1. Do not aspirate more than pipette's max volume. For example, if you want to aspirate 2000 ÂµL with a p1000_single, you need to split it into two commands.
2. Check the number of tips you use to avoid running out of tips.
3. when load_labware('name', slot), you can't declare the same slot twice, you need to use different slots for different labware.

answer:*************************
I'm happy to help you write a Python script to run the Opentrons machine with the specified protocol. Here's the script:

```python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.11',
    'protocolName': 'Automated Laboratory Experiment',
    'author': 'Assistant',
    'description': 'Python script for automating biology experiment using Opentrons machine',
}

def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
    # Labware
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_1000ul', '1')
    tuberack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_10_tuberack_falcon_4x50ml_6x15ml_conical', '2')
    well_plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_6_wellplate_16.8ml_flat', '3')
    
    # Pipette
    pipette = protocol.load_instrument('p1000_single', 'right', tip_racks=[tiprack])
    
    # Solutions
    PBS_minus = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A1']
    trypsin_solution = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A2']
    DMEM_medium = tuberack.wells_by_name()['A3']

    # Step 1: Wash the 6 well plate with PBS(-)
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        for _ in range(5):
            pipette.aspirate(1000, PBS_minus)
            pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # Step 2: Add 1 ml trypsin (0.25%) to the 6 well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.aspirate(1000, trypsin_solution)
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    protocol.delay(minutes=5) # 5 minute waiting time

    # Step 3: Add 1 mL of cell culture medium (DMEM) to the 6 well plate
    for well in well_plate.wells():
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.aspirate(1000, DMEM_medium)
        pipette.dispense(1000, well)
        pipette.drop_tip()

    # Step 4: Finish the experiment
```

This script has been written for the Opentrons protocol API version 2.11. You can run the script using an Opentrons OT-2 robot.
