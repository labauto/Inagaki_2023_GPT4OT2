    Yes, you are getting an error because Opentrons does not recognize the labware definition for the "corning_6_wellplate_16.4ml_flat" that you are trying to load. Please make sure that you have downloaded the "corning_6_wellplate_16.4ml_flat" labware definition file in the OT-2 app from the Opentrons Library under the "Labware" tab.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```
can you fix it? Make sure you only answer Python script.
answer:*************************
I see that you included a message in your error. Please remove that message and only include the Python script code for the experiment. This will make it easier for me to help you with the issue.
