prompt:*************************
 
I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Exchanging hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM.
The cell is cultured in 6 well plate.

answer:*************************
Sure, here's a Python script that will exchange hMSC cell culture medium using PBS(-) and D-MEM in a 6 well plate using the Opentrons machine:

```python
# Import the required modules
from opentrons import labware, instruments, robot

# Define the labware
plate = labware.load('6-well-plate', 'C2')
tiprack = labware.load('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', 'B2')

# Define the pipette and tiprack
p300 = instruments.P300_Single(
    mount='left',
    tip_racks=[tiprack]
)

# Define the volumes and movements for the transfer
total_volume = 200  # uL
pbs_volume = 100  # uL
dmem_volume = 100  # uL

# Define the locations for the PBS and D-MEM
pbs_location = 'A1'
dmem_location = 'A2'

# Loop through each well in the plate and perform the exchange
for well in plate.wells():
    # Aspirate the current medium from the well
    p300.aspirate(total_volume, well)

    # Dispense the PBS into the well
    p300.dispense(pbs_volume, robot.deck[pbs_location])
    p300.mix(5, pbs_volume, well)  # Mix the medium for 5 times

    # Aspirate the PBS from the well
    p300.aspirate(pbs_volume, well)

    # Dispense the D-MEM into the well
    p300.dispense(dmem_volume, robot.deck[dmem_location])
    p300.mix(5, dmem_volume, well)  # Mix the medium for 5 times

    # Aspirate the D-MEM from the well
    p300.aspirate(dmem_volume, well)
  
    # Dispense the exchanged medium back into the well
    p300.dispense(total_volume, well)
```

This script defines the labware, pipette, and volumes for the transfer, and then loops through each well in the plate, performing the medium exchange using a mix function to mix the medium multiple times.

Make sure to calibrate the Opentrons machine before running the script, and adjust the volumes and locations as needed for your specific experiment.
